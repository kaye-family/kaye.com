      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Granger Machinery holds regional exclusive parts franchises for two farm machinery manufacturers.  They stock after-market truck engine and tractor parts for other manufacturers on a non-exclusive basis.  With the purchase of a related wholesale business in southern Indiana, the company has sixty employees.<br /><br />Until four years ago, Frank Granger couldn’t foresee the company’s future, or his own and his son’s financial security. <br /><br />Eddie, 39, has worked at Granger Machinery for nine years, primarily taking telephone orders.  He spent his twenties as an itinerant sailboat crewman and competitive windsurfer.  He’s a likeable young man with learning disabilities that make him shun any kind of training that involves books and numbers.  Even simple order taking suffers from his errors.  As Frank grew increasingly critical, Eddie became increasingly defensive. <br /><br />Eddie views his father’s unwillingness to hand over the company to him as a “letting go” problem.  On the contrary, Frank is more than ready to turn the company over—to his competent son-in-law—only hesitating out of concern for Eddie’s feelings and livelihood.<br /><br />Eddie’s older sister and her husband, Mark, moved from Chicago down to Danville four years ago, so that Mark could come on board as General Manager.  Well qualified, Mark has done a great job.<br /><br />Eddie talks as if he and Mark will run the company more or less as equals once his father retires.  “If he wants to be President, I’ll be General Manager, I don’t care.   Or we could take turns, him five years and then me for the next five or whatever.  I heard about a family business where they do like that.”  It seems an astonishingly naïve outlook—no reference to skills, work history, or leadership.  Eddie’s unrealistic vision of the future is about to be dashed by Mark’s and Frank’s plans.<br /><br />Mark and Diane approached Frank diplomatically about purchasing a majority of the stock.  Frank promised to get advice about how to transfer control to Mark within an estate plan that includes Eddie and another, oldest daughter not involved in the business. <br /><br />Diane says her brother “really wants to stay in the family business, answering the phone ‘Granger Machinery, Ed Granger here.’ ”  She and Mark both feel it will be possible to keep Ed as an employee, compensated appropriately for his sales performance, after Dad leaves.<br /><br />The senior Grangers pick me up at my motel and we drive over the Indiana border to the Beef House restaurant for dinner.  They’ve mentioned that it’s just off I-74, so I’m surprised when instead of driving south toward that east-west highway, Frank heads his white Lincoln north to the edge of town and then off onto a little farm road.  We drive between eight-foot-high corn and low soybean plants, the latter dark green, sharply illuminated by the setting sun behind us.  Ahead, incandescent pink clouds spread across the horizon.  We pass a tractor towing some sort of menacing implement.  Frank and the farmer wave at one another. <br /><br />Peg Granger is a retired English teacher.  Well informed about business and legal matters, she participates in all financial and estate planning meetings.  She and Frank own 100% of the business.   They reckon it’s worth about $2.5M today, which constitutes 80% of their net worth.  At 67, he wants to retire within two years, if possible. <br /><br />How can the Grangers treat their three children equally in their estate plan, while ensuring that Mark and Diane get at least a controlling share of the business and that Eddie can stay in the company without hampering Mark?<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">copyright reserved 2006, Kaye Family Business Associates, Inc.</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

    <p><h3>Family Feuds in the News</h3><span style="font-size:80%;"><b>5/7/07 FBI Raids Congressman's Family Business ... </b>U.S. Congressman Rick Renzi, Republican of Arizona, has stepped down from his position on the House Intelligence Committee while his family's business is investigated. According to <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/12news/news/articles/0419renzi0419-ON-CP.html">the Arizona Republic</a>, "The Justice Department has been investigating Renzi for months, but the subject of the probe has never been made public. Media reports last fall gave conflicting versions, with authorities said to be looking into either a land swap involving a former business partner of Renzi's or a Pentagon contract involving Renzi's father, a retired Army general."
<br><br><b>2/7/07 Son settles with Sumner Redstone ... </b>Ongoing Redstone family saga: <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_5164430" target="_blank">Denver Post.</a>

<br><br><b>12/28/06 What Would Rockwell Do?</b> -- Three brothers have been fighting in court for 13 years over an estate that includes a dozen of Norman Rockwell's most famous paintings.  Their father, Ken Stuart, took the original oils when he retired as an editor at <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>. (Some say he stole them, but that's another story).  It seems that when Dad was in his eighties, dying of Alzheimer's, the eldest son persuaded him to put everything into a family partnership with Ken Jr. as general partner.  The younger brothers charge Ken Stuart, Jr. with spending partnership assets on such things as alimony for his first wife, a Rolex for his second, a vintage cello for his daughter and a time-share condo. He contends he deserved those payments for 'services rendered.' But the bulk of the estate consists of the art, valued at over $25M, which cannot be sold until the lawsuits and counter-suits are resolved.
<br>The Times points out that unlike some family court battles, this one hasn't drained the family's wealth, because the paintings' value has soared while control is in dispute.  But it surely has drained away brotherly relations.  Think of those iconic images of family bonding depicted in such famous <i>Post</i> covers as 'Saying Grace' and 'Walking to Church,' to name two in their collection. Wonder if the Stuart family ever asks, 'What would Norman Rockwell do?'

<br><br><b>11/21/06 Nephew sues Sumner Redstone ... </b>Viacom chairman cut him and his sister out of their share of the family firm. Read article in <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-redstone21nov21,1,6711195.story?coll=la-headlines-business" target="_blank">LA Times.</a>

<br><br><b>10/16/06 Brooke Astor's son backs down</b> -- Anthony D. Marshall was sued by his son over managing 104-year-old Mrs. Astor's wealth. The grandson, Philip Marshall, alleged that his 82-year-old father, Astor's only son, cut back on her medications and subjected her to 'deplorable conditions' in her Park Avenue duplex while enriching himself through sales of her art. A New York State Supreme Court judge appointed J.P. Morgan Chase Bank and the wife of Oscar de la Renta, a long-time friend of the ancient socialite, as temporary guardians. This week Anthony agreed to relinquish his role as steward of his mother's wealth in exchange for Chase dropping litigation to recover the millions it believes he already bilked his mother out of.

<br><br>The <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/brooke_astor/index.html?inline=nyt-per" target="_blank">NY media</a> have painted the picture, sad enough, of the woman who was a doyenne of society for decades and one of the city's most important philanthropists, confined to quarters by dementia and paralysis. But the even sadder story remains to be told: how her son and her grandson came to be so estranged that the latter raked his father through the courts and the newspapers. Is it purely concern for Granny's welfare? Or is he setting the stage for an even more vicious battle over the estate when she passes on?</span></p>
