      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Most family firm conflicts don’t result from anything “dysfunctional” in the family. There isn’t necessarily any “baggage” from childhood rivalries; nor are there always personality issues, spoiled brats, or greedy in-laws. Conflict is often simply a result of not having thought through the consequences of business succession and estate planning.<br /><br />This fictional case illustrates one of the commonest of such avoidable consequences. With variations, it’s a pattern that all experienced consultants will recognize. Jack was the second generation sole owner of a construction company. Three of his children had worked there for 22, 20, and 13 years, respectively. (I’m going to call Jack and Sylvia’s six children the <span style="font-style: italic;">siblings </span>so the case isn’t complicated by the issue of brothers vs. sisters, which it usually would be.) Two of the three other siblings worked at Jaxco for a few years, but by the time Jack was ready to retire, they had gone on to other careers (including homemaking).<br /><br />Jack and Sylvia sold Jaxco to the three who wanted to acquire it. Let’s say they purchased it in equal shares. Payment was in the form of a note, with interest, over a twenty year term, which made the payments low enough so the buyers could take distributions from Jaxco each year which were sufficient, after income tax, to pay Jack and Sylvia.<br /><br />What’s wrong with that? Nothing, but you probably see where I’m going. In Jack’s mind, the successor owners “got” the business. They didn’t really buy it—the business bought itself for them. If the three of them never protested his way of describing the deal, they must not have known or allowed themselves to dwell upon the second half of Jack’s summary: “… so the others will get everything else.”<br /><br />Now Jack is dead, and the eldest sibling, 54, whose children are well launched into careers unrelated to construction, wants to sell out and move to Hawaii. The owners’ buy/sell specifies a clear formula. One of the others may buy the offered stock, thereby owning two thirds of the company; the company must redeem it, leaving the two of them as equal owners.<br /><br />Either way, the seller and his or her spouse still have to pay their share of the debt to Mom, as well as capital gains on the shares. They learn, if they weren’t aware before, that Sylvia’s substantial estate (she and Jack were well fixed even before investing those note payments for more than a decade) will all go to the non-successor sibs. So the eldest can’t afford to retire. Yet the other two had been looking forward to his or her doing so. Suddenly we have a reluctant owner/president and disappointed partners. Now every normal disagreement, which they dealt with reasonably in the past, becomes emotionally fraught with frustration, mutual blame, betrayal, resentment, charges of favoritism, guilt and fear of disharmony in the family as a whole.<br /><br />Only now do they call a family business dynamics consultant. How I would have liked to sit in twelve years ago when Jack and his attorney figured everything out for the family! There’s not so subtle pressure on Sylvia from the three owners to change her will. “We <span style="font-style: italic;">paid </span>for the business,” they say. “It’s not like you gave it to us.” Yet Sylvia remembers that Jack and she had been in agreement on this. For years, she thought the formula “Those three got the business, and the others will get everything else” was the accepted family definition of fairness. Faithfulness to Jack’s vision for his estate is only one of several factors that make it hard for her to even consider a change in her own will. Yet an equal number of emotional factors incline her toward “correcting the unfairness”: her fondness and sympathy for her eldest child; her disappointment with two of the others, who moved across the continent; and the fact that the third of the non-successors married into great wealth, while Jaxco, frankly, has been only modestly successful.<br /><br />What’s fair? Does the answer depend on the relative value of the business today compared with Sylvia’s net worth today?  Should she write the child who wants out of the business into her will, while still excluding the other two? Or what?<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">copyright reserved 2006, Kaye Family Business Associates, Inc.</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

    <p><h3>Family Feuds in the News</h3><span style="font-size:80%;"><b>5/7/07 FBI Raids Congressman's Family Business ... </b>U.S. Congressman Rick Renzi, Republican of Arizona, has stepped down from his position on the House Intelligence Committee while his family's business is investigated. According to <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/12news/news/articles/0419renzi0419-ON-CP.html">the Arizona Republic</a>, "The Justice Department has been investigating Renzi for months, but the subject of the probe has never been made public. Media reports last fall gave conflicting versions, with authorities said to be looking into either a land swap involving a former business partner of Renzi's or a Pentagon contract involving Renzi's father, a retired Army general."
<br><br><b>2/7/07 Son settles with Sumner Redstone ... </b>Ongoing Redstone family saga: <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_5164430" target="_blank">Denver Post.</a>

<br><br><b>12/28/06 What Would Rockwell Do?</b> -- Three brothers have been fighting in court for 13 years over an estate that includes a dozen of Norman Rockwell's most famous paintings.  Their father, Ken Stuart, took the original oils when he retired as an editor at <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>. (Some say he stole them, but that's another story).  It seems that when Dad was in his eighties, dying of Alzheimer's, the eldest son persuaded him to put everything into a family partnership with Ken Jr. as general partner.  The younger brothers charge Ken Stuart, Jr. with spending partnership assets on such things as alimony for his first wife, a Rolex for his second, a vintage cello for his daughter and a time-share condo. He contends he deserved those payments for 'services rendered.' But the bulk of the estate consists of the art, valued at over $25M, which cannot be sold until the lawsuits and counter-suits are resolved.
<br>The Times points out that unlike some family court battles, this one hasn't drained the family's wealth, because the paintings' value has soared while control is in dispute.  But it surely has drained away brotherly relations.  Think of those iconic images of family bonding depicted in such famous <i>Post</i> covers as 'Saying Grace' and 'Walking to Church,' to name two in their collection. Wonder if the Stuart family ever asks, 'What would Norman Rockwell do?'

<br><br><b>11/21/06 Nephew sues Sumner Redstone ... </b>Viacom chairman cut him and his sister out of their share of the family firm. Read article in <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-redstone21nov21,1,6711195.story?coll=la-headlines-business" target="_blank">LA Times.</a>

<br><br><b>10/16/06 Brooke Astor's son backs down</b> -- Anthony D. Marshall was sued by his son over managing 104-year-old Mrs. Astor's wealth. The grandson, Philip Marshall, alleged that his 82-year-old father, Astor's only son, cut back on her medications and subjected her to 'deplorable conditions' in her Park Avenue duplex while enriching himself through sales of her art. A New York State Supreme Court judge appointed J.P. Morgan Chase Bank and the wife of Oscar de la Renta, a long-time friend of the ancient socialite, as temporary guardians. This week Anthony agreed to relinquish his role as steward of his mother's wealth in exchange for Chase dropping litigation to recover the millions it believes he already bilked his mother out of.

<br><br>The <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/brooke_astor/index.html?inline=nyt-per" target="_blank">NY media</a> have painted the picture, sad enough, of the woman who was a doyenne of society for decades and one of the city's most important philanthropists, confined to quarters by dementia and paralysis. But the even sadder story remains to be told: how her son and her grandson came to be so estranged that the latter raked his father through the courts and the newspapers. Is it purely concern for Granny's welfare? Or is he setting the stage for an even more vicious battle over the estate when she passes on?</span></p>
