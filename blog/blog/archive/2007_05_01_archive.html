	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;"><i>(NOTE: Every story is a highly disguised composite of several actual cases. All identifying details are changed, including names, family size, industry, genders and ages. I've fictionalized them so carefully that any resemblance to a real person or family would be coincidental.)</i><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;">Many families have said their Dad’s business was like a mistress: consuming his time, money, and passion. Ralph Blivin’s son and daughter suspected a flesh and blood mistress as well. I had to admit that was a plausible hypothesis.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;">Ralph, 74, hadn’t lived at home for several years, as his wife’s diabetes-related health problems deteriorated. “To make room for the nurses” was his ostensible reason, which Sam and Karla didn’t challenge. But they did complain as his visits to Mom became less and less frequent. Karla, of course, visited her mother daily and coordinated all the medical, home care, and household logistics. As well as her own three young children and husband, she did her share of helping Ralph when he entertained customers and suppliers. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;">Mom was too heavy to be moved in and out of her chair by one person alone. She also suffered from morbid depression. Karla chided her father, “She still has her mind, you know. She’s always asking me if you’re all right.” </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;">Her brother Sam did stop by the house briefly most weekdays, on his way home. But he worked ten- to twelve-hour days, and saved the weekends for his wife and children. “We don’t think it’s good for them to see their grandmother like she is.”</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;">Sad as it was for Mom, the Blivins had settled into an angry equilibrium. Over the years, Sam gradually took on more and more responsibility, as his father argued with him (and with me) every step of the way. I could have challenged these clients on their relations outside of the business side, but I was on shaky ground with Ralph as it was, constantly ignoring his insistence that the only succession problem was Sam’s bullheadedness.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;">Ever since Ralph bought his high-rise condo retreat, he’d stopped coming in every day. He still called Sam every morning as well as the CFO and plant managers about details more appropriate to a small plant owner than the CEO of a $200M company. Sam and Karla touted Ralph as a genius who started wo a nickel and built Alltech Plastics into a nationwide leader in their niche. But Sam said Ralph was now “overcompensating for his age or something,” as he pushed them to be first to adopt the newest computer-guided machinery. Sam saw competitors shrewdly waiting for the second or third generation of those innovations, saving tens of millions in costs as the prices would drop, and avoiding “Betamax commitments,” as he called them. I’d heard father and son argue over that for years, Sam citing examples of Ralph’s premature changeovers in the past. “I guess we really screwed up all those times,” Ralph said sarcastically. “It’s a wonder we got where we are.”</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;">When they came to a Board decision, Karla’s was the third of three votes. She increasingly supported her brother’s conservatism against her father’s mania to be “first with the best.” Disrespected, Ralph accused her of turning against him “because of her mother—she blames me.”</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;">Ralph had often said, “If you don’t want me as Chairman and CEO, it’s two against one. You can have the whole company.” At the same time, he warned Karla that Sam, who had bought an original partner’s small stake, would have 53% of the stock if the company acquired Ralph’s. Karla had no motive to participate in a buyout. Furthermore, she feared it would kill her father: “It’s his whole life.”</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;">Yet Ralph, to her surprise and Sam’s irritation, kept offering to leave. Sam wavered. Why should he pay for Sam’s stock, then maybe have to buy his sister’s eventually too, leaving himself with the risk and her witl the nice liquid assets?</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;">It was the “other woman”--though never acknowledged by Ralph—whose presumed existence led to a breakthrough. Karla discovered, managing Mom’s household accounts, that her father only deposited $10,000 a month—a fourth of his Alltech income. Estimating that over a million dollars were unaccounted for, she and Sam confronted Ralph. “You think we’re going to finance a $70M buyout only to have that money go out of the family?” That was the closest they ever came to suggesting they thought—knew—Dad had someone else in the picture.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;">But he surprised them. “My stock is marital property,” he said. “Put it in your mother’s name, I don’t care. But give me a severance, five years’ consulting at my current salary. It’s none of your business how I choose to spend that.”</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;">Deal? Or no deal?</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-style: italic;">copyright reserved 2006, Kaye Family Business Associates, Inc.</span></p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

    <p><h3>Family Feuds in the News</h3><span style="font-size:80%;"><b>5/7/07 FBI Raids Congressman's Family Business ... </b>U.S. Congressman Rick Renzi, Republican of Arizona, has stepped down from his position on the House Intelligence Committee while his family's business is investigated. According to <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/12news/news/articles/0419renzi0419-ON-CP.html">the Arizona Republic</a>, "The Justice Department has been investigating Renzi for months, but the subject of the probe has never been made public. Media reports last fall gave conflicting versions, with authorities said to be looking into either a land swap involving a former business partner of Renzi's or a Pentagon contract involving Renzi's father, a retired Army general."
<br><br><b>2/7/07 Son settles with Sumner Redstone ... </b>Ongoing Redstone family saga: <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_5164430" target="_blank">Denver Post.</a>

<br><br><b>12/28/06 What Would Rockwell Do?</b> -- Three brothers have been fighting in court for 13 years over an estate that includes a dozen of Norman Rockwell's most famous paintings.  Their father, Ken Stuart, took the original oils when he retired as an editor at <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>. (Some say he stole them, but that's another story).  It seems that when Dad was in his eighties, dying of Alzheimer's, the eldest son persuaded him to put everything into a family partnership with Ken Jr. as general partner.  The younger brothers charge Ken Stuart, Jr. with spending partnership assets on such things as alimony for his first wife, a Rolex for his second, a vintage cello for his daughter and a time-share condo. He contends he deserved those payments for 'services rendered.' But the bulk of the estate consists of the art, valued at over $25M, which cannot be sold until the lawsuits and counter-suits are resolved.
<br>The Times points out that unlike some family court battles, this one hasn't drained the family's wealth, because the paintings' value has soared while control is in dispute.  But it surely has drained away brotherly relations.  Think of those iconic images of family bonding depicted in such famous <i>Post</i> covers as 'Saying Grace' and 'Walking to Church,' to name two in their collection. Wonder if the Stuart family ever asks, 'What would Norman Rockwell do?'

<br><br><b>11/21/06 Nephew sues Sumner Redstone ... </b>Viacom chairman cut him and his sister out of their share of the family firm. Read article in <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-redstone21nov21,1,6711195.story?coll=la-headlines-business" target="_blank">LA Times.</a>

<br><br><b>10/16/06 Brooke Astor's son backs down</b> -- Anthony D. Marshall was sued by his son over managing 104-year-old Mrs. Astor's wealth. The grandson, Philip Marshall, alleged that his 82-year-old father, Astor's only son, cut back on her medications and subjected her to 'deplorable conditions' in her Park Avenue duplex while enriching himself through sales of her art. A New York State Supreme Court judge appointed J.P. Morgan Chase Bank and the wife of Oscar de la Renta, a long-time friend of the ancient socialite, as temporary guardians. This week Anthony agreed to relinquish his role as steward of his mother's wealth in exchange for Chase dropping litigation to recover the millions it believes he already bilked his mother out of.

<br><br>The <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/brooke_astor/index.html?inline=nyt-per" target="_blank">NY media</a> have painted the picture, sad enough, of the woman who was a doyenne of society for decades and one of the city's most important philanthropists, confined to quarters by dementia and paralysis. But the even sadder story remains to be told: how her son and her grandson came to be so estranged that the latter raked his father through the courts and the newspapers. Is it purely concern for Granny's welfare? Or is he setting the stage for an even more vicious battle over the estate when she passes on?</span></p>
