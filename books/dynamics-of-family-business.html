        <br><br><p><b>"If there is one core issue facing family business it is how to overcome conflict and establish the trust that is vital in effective working relationships.

He has identified and explored the myriad of interactions among elements of conflict, from the role of childhood experience and family pathology to more immediate issues such as salary and dividends.  His forays into topics such as the ways family firms tend to sustain problems, or the process of mate selection, are courageous and insightful."</b></p>
