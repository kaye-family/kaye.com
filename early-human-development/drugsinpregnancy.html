<p><span class=GramE>Introductory chapter to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Drug Use in Pregnancy: Mother and Child</i>,
edited by Ira J. <span class=SpellE>Chasnoff</span>, MD.</span> MTP <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Press</st1:City>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">UK</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
1986, pp. 1-6.</p>

<p>In
the past 10-15 years, drug use in our society has increased among women of
childbearing age. Concurrently, our understanding of the dangers posed by any
extreme disruption of fetal life, childbirth, or postnatal care has deepened by
an order of magnitude. We have a more comprehensive view of the effects babies
and mothers and fathers normally have upon one another. Therefore the task of
pediatricians, nurses, and psychologists concerned with helping addicted
neonatal families is more complex than it was thought to be 15 years ago. The
intricacies of the social interactions through which the human mind is
acquired, the turn-taking structure which characterizes these interactions from
the beginning, the fact that all human parents constantly provide a framework
of experiences for their infants&apos; encounters with the physical as well as the
social world, and the sensitive use that a normal mother or father makes of
those innate properties of infant behavior to gradually construct meaningful
communicative exchanges long before the baby even understands what meaning is:
all these aspects of human development are relevant to concerns regarding the
effects of maternal substance abuse on the developing fetus and child.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b

PARENT &mdash; INFANT SYSTEM</span></b></p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b></p>

<p>Normal
human development begins within the context of a system of parental and family interaction.
What we learned from observations of parent-infant play is that parents
instinctively do many things that help an infant emit behaviors that are
actually beyond the capability of the infant alone. Infant development
continues to unfold and progress within a context in which the infant is an
apprentice to the parents. In this way a parent is like a master shoemaker who
begins his teaching by setting up small tasks which are slightly beyond his
apprentice&apos;s competence. The shoemaker closely supervises the apprentice&apos;s work
and intervenes when necessary, or gives additional details when the apprentice
appears ready. Often this help is offered in anticipation of problems in order
to assure positive experiences for the apprentice, thereby reinforcing the
apprentice&apos;s confidence to expand his own competence further. It is within this
apprenticeship setting that parents and other caretakers provide for infants. This
structuring framework is species-specific and instinctive for humans and,
therefore, universally present in human parenting. Such parenting behaviors constitute
the environment of every human infant, whether extremely advantaged or
disadvantaged. However, the behaviors may be presented with greater or less
sensitivity to the child&apos;s needs at the moment, with greater or less
consistency, and with accurate or inaccurate readings of a baby&apos;s intentions
and skill. Thus, these behavioral processes are susceptible to impairment.</p>

<p>The most common setting in which mother-infant interaction has been
studied has been during face-to-face play. Results of these studies have
identified predictable patterns of interaction within normal mother-infant dyads.
At 2 months of age it is the mother who initiates greetings when eye contact is
made. As the infant matures, such greetings begin to be initiated by the baby. My
students and I call this communicative setting the &lsquo;dialogue frame,&apos; a focus of
mother and infant on one another with readiness to communicate. The dialogue
frame begins with a mother talking to an infant <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>in <span class=SpellE>utero</span></i> and continues with turn-taking
during the pseudo-dialogues in face-to-face play. This dialogue frame will turn
into real dialogue as soon as the infant is old enough to talk, but in the
meantime it evolves into other kinds of frames which, we believe, are crucial
to the infant&apos;s cognitive development.</p>

<p>Another common pattern of interactive behavior in normal mother-infant dyads
is the &lsquo;instrumental frame.&apos; An illustration of this pattern would be the case <span
class=GramE>of an infant placing shapes</span> into matching holes in a sphere.
In early infancy a baby is only successful at such a task if his mother rotates
the sphere to present the correctly shaped hole in front of him. This &lsquo;instrumental
frame&apos; is also demonstrated in the behavior of a mother who steadies a tower f
blocks each time her infant places a new one on the top. Caretakers provide
this type of active guidance of an infant&apos;s behavior without any awareness that
they are doing so. This guidance or &lsquo;instrumental frame&apos; makes it possible for infants
to be more effective at performing tasks than they would be by themselves.</p>

<p>Even in the course of normal mother-infant interaction, difficulties
may arise that interfere with the smooth ongoing dialogue. A normal infant is
not always ready to respond to his mother&apos;s invitation to interact each time
she gazes at the infant&apos;s face. Understandably, this rejection of maternal gaze
by the infant can be upsetting to some mothers, especially to those who are
already anxious about mothering, or in personal distress. By and large,
however, mothers tend to accept the cycles of attention from their infants as
normal variation and fit them into their maternal dialogues as opportunity
permits. They continue using the dialogue frame and the instrumental frame
until the infant learns to become genuine participants in the interaction. For
example, a mother with a 2 month old infant may pretend that they are holding
hands and talking to each other. Actually, only one of them is holding the
other&apos;s hand, and microanalysis of such sequences at that age show that babies
don&apos;t really initiate greetings; mothers structure their own greetings in such
a way that there is a high likelihood of eliciting a response. After 3 months
of this maternal guidance, when this same infant has reached 5 months of age, the
infant is initiating vocal greetings and smiles as often as the mother.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>APPRENTICESHIP</span></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Our
theory that early human development proceeds as an apprenticeship is a way of
integrating findings from studies of mother-infant interaction. The
apprenticeship progresses through a series of stages. The first stage during
the first 2 months of life is a period of &lsquo;shared rhythms and regulations&apos; in which
the intrinsic self-regulatory processes of the neonate are <span class=SpellE>marshalled</span>
by extrinsic functions residing in the adult of the species. The second stage,
from 2 to 8 months, is a period <span class=SpellE>od</span> &lsquo;shared intentions,&apos;
when adults infer what the baby is trying to accomplish and enable him to begin
to fulfill intentions. He is thus able to practice the sensory-motor schemas which
are constituent modules of more and more intelligent acts, as Piaget (1952) and
Bruner (1972) have shown.</p>

<p>The period of &lsquo;shared memory&apos; begins at about 8 months, when infants
and parents begin playing stereotypic games remembered from one day to the next
by both partners, yet still depending upon the parent&apos;s greater responsibility
for simplifying, structuring, and suggesting. Finally, in the second year comes
the period of &lsquo;shared language,&apos; by which time the baby is not only
comprehending and producing gestures within dyadic relationships but is a
self-conscious member of the family system.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>THE
HIGH-RISK SYSTEM</span></b></p>

<p><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p>The
quality of parenting shown by chemically normal human mothers varies widely, with
comfortable, confident mothers at one end and anxious, perhaps depressed or
neurotic mothers at the other end of a normal spectrum. All along that spectrum
we see plenty of variability in the effectiveness of their interactive
behaviors and in the smoothness with which they orchestrate the synchrony of
turn-taking in their relationship. Therefore any investigation of deviant mother-infant
interaction must take into consideration its complexities. It would be
convenient if one could simply predict that any baby whose physical system has
been affected by his mother&apos;s chemical dependence will fail to elicit
appropriate reactions from the parents or caretakers, or fail to respond to
their stimulation. However, such failings may be only one aspect of many
interwoven events that cumulatively create interactive deficiencies.</p>

<p>In other words, it would be a vast oversimplification to conceptualize
the problem of substance abuse in terms of effects of drugs upon the developing
fetus and child, and consider nothing more than that. Such oversimplification
fits a medical or linear cause/effect model. Admittedly, such a model provides
a rationale for preventive medicine: keep pregnant women off drugs. It also
provides a basis for intervention, but only for the baby. It suggests that our
response should be to find the best possible medical treatment for the newborn,
as well as psychological interventions to counteract any deficits in the
development f the child&apos;s intellectual capacities or personality.</p>

<p>A more realistic, if complicated view is that whatever effects drug
abuse has upon the fetus, its effects are likely to play out upon the
developing child through a multi-layered interaction. The factors in that
interaction include at least the following: the infant&apos;s neurological system,
the parents&apos; sensitivities, <span class=GramE>the</span> infant&apos;s ability to
make sense of the cues his parents offer him, and the parents&apos; expectations. All
four of those factors must be kept in mind when evaluating chemically dependent
newborns.</p>

<p>In regard to the first factor, neurological status, the passively
addicted newborn may not present t the mother as alertly or as engagingly as a
normal infant. <span class=GramE>One of the frequent observations by researchers
with &lsquo;high-risk infants&apos; is that some of them are not fully &lsquo;there&apos; for their
parents to respond to.</span> This problem has been at the center of <span
class=SpellE>Brazelton&apos;s</span> (1976) work at Harvard for nearly 20 years:
evaluating newborns so as to be ale to predict their developmental course over
the early weeks of life and thus be able to counsel parents regarding the
strengths and weaknesses of their infant. </p>

<p>The second aspect of &lsquo;high-risk infants&apos; is that the baby, and often
the mother, requires extra hospital care. This interferes with the normal
process of acquaintance for the two members of the dyad by keeping them apart
and by labeling the baby as &lsquo;abnormal.&apos; The neonatal and/or maternal care
distances an already at-risk mother from her infant.</p>

<p>The remaining factors, the baby&apos;s intelligence and the parents&apos;
expectations, add a further level of complexity to the notion of risk. The
newborn&apos;s developmental tasks can be conceptualized in terms of entering the family
system as a deficient though stimulating organism, being co-opted by parental
frames and only slowly becoming a full member of the system, a person with a
mind and a sense of self (Kaye, 1982). This whole process of assimilation into
the family system for the purpose of development has been provided for by human
evolution, both in the form of <span class=SpellE>neurologic</span> mechanisms
present in the neonatal organism, which stimulate adults to act in the way the
organism needs them to act, and also in the form of instincts in parents to
provide the kinds of frames babies need in order to become parents.</p>

<p>Although parental behaviors are somewhat guided by instincts, as they
are in the rest of the animal kingdom, human parental behaviors are often
strongly influenced by socially acquired characteristics such as maternal
expectations for the baby. It may be these expectations on the part of
drug-abusing mothers that guide many of their early interactive behaviors. Therefore,
a baby born to a chemically dependent mother might be at risk for starting the
interactive process with the handicap of negative maternal expectations, even
if the baby has no physiological or neurological effects of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in <span class=SpellE>utero</span></i> drug
exposure. Mothers who abuse drugs during pregnancy are often told that their
baby will be at risk; or they assume that such a risk exists because they have
seen warnings about using drugs during pregnancy. Such an expectation could place
the mother-infant interaction at risk of dysfunction even in the absence of any
physical factors. </p>

<p>In reality, of course, drug-using mothers not only have those negative
expectations, but their infants often confirm their fears, being sleepy,
jittery, withdrawing and irritable. Repeated instances of under- and
over-responsiveness from her infant may prematurely convince even a patient
mother that her infant is impaired, retarded or in pain, and that it is her
fault. Worse, she may begin to believe that her infant is intentionally
rejecting her.</p>

<p>This downward spiral of negative effects can be intensified if the
mother herself is deficient in self-esteem. Such a case would be missed in the linear
or medical model. Simplistic cause/effect thinking omits the factors leading to
or complicating the mother&apos;s drug dependence: her addictive personality,
poverty, emotional deprivation, ignorance and a whole host of indicators or
poor readiness to be a parent. Whichever of those factors operates in a
pregnant woman, and in her spouse or nuclear family, will be vital aspects of
the social system into which the baby is born, even if that baby is medically
protected from the mother&apos;s substance abuse; indeed, even if the mother&apos;s
chemical dependence was already in the past when she conceived.</p>

PROBLEM OF DRUG ABUSE</span></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It
appears that the <span class=SpellE>frequenc</span> ad severity of drug abuse
in pregnancy continue to <span class=SpellE>to</span> grow. Researchers face a
number of critical issues: Which developmental processes in the exposed infant are
<span class=SpellE>mosr</span> affected? Are there critical periods for the
fetus or the embryo? What are the subtle effects that combine with maternal characteristics
to affect such complex processes as mother-infant interaction? The authors of
the following chapters ask those questions in hopes of stimulating more
productive investigations and eventually more effective treatment plans. Protecting
an infant from the effects of illicit substance use by its mother protects it
from only one aspect of a <span class=SpellE>multidetermined</span>
pathological system. It is that system, not the drug use alone, that any
therapeutic endeavor has to address.</p>
