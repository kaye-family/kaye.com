normal'>Although my two</b> colleagues on this panel are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>bona fide</i> philosophers who clearly have a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>bona fide</i> interest in the ongoing controversy over IQ and the
        educability of children, I nonetheless feel constrained to say a word in
        defense of our topic as a viable subject for discussion in a forum devoted to
        the Philosophy of Science. Perhaps this is because, as the representative of
        the discipline that created this mess, I fear you might associate me with it.
        You might feel that bad science is a bad subject for study by philosophers of
        science, and furthermore that anyone associated with such a discipline would be
        the last person to have anything intelligent to say about philosophy.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>While it is
        true that we do not a need a philosophy of bad science, a kind of
        <st1:City

        ’s Law seems
        sometimes to operate, in which bad science drives out the good. The reasons for
        which that happens, and the reasoning by which it is allowed to happen, surely
        are both within the purview of philosophers as well as historians of science.
        Furthermore, the current controversies in educational psychology have already
        raised a number of questions among philosophers (though not entirely
        philosophical questions), to which the answers will depend upon an
        understanding of some empirical findings, some methodological biases, and some
        operational definitions. Partly I wish to add to what my fellow panelists have just
        said; but I also wish to make a somewhat different, though not contradictory
        argument.
    </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>At issue, from
        one point of view, are a set of statistics called heritability estimates, which
        are supposed to tell us about the relative innateness, fixedness, determinedness
        of a child’s potential intelligence. From another point of view, at issue are a
        set of social policies referred to as streaming or tracking, which have to do
        with the allocation of resources to children within schools, and the optimal
        forms of grouping for education. The reason we have a full-blown controversy is
        that these two major issues intersect. Or rather they are regarded as
        intersecting by nearly everyone: psychologists, educators, and the readers of
        magazines. It is assumed that knowing whether intelligence is innately
        determined will tell us how children ought to be grouped in school. Sometimes
        the even more outrageous converse is assumed, that knowing how we wish to
        organize our schools will tell us what we must believe about the nature and
        development of intelligence. But let us first look at the issue of heritability
        of IQ, and return later to the social-political context of the educational
        issues.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>It has been
        pointed out, by my predecessors on this panel as well as by others, that we
        have no scientific reason for believing that the heritability of IQ is as high
        as Cyril Burt, Arthur Jensen, and Hans <span class=SpellE>Eysenck</span> have
        claimed. I think this is true. The twin studies are inadequately controlled and
        are biased, etc. On the other hand, I do not think we have any basis for
        believing that IQ has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>low</i>
        heritability. It would be astonishing, given the nature of the IQ test, if IQ
        were not heritable. The important point to be added to the criticisms you have
        just heard, without in any way denying their force, is that IQ heritability
        tells us nothing whatever about the educability of children. Nothing whatever.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>Heritability
        is a measure of the amount of variance in some trait which is accounted for, in
        a particular environment, by genotypic variance in a population. Heritability
        depends upon the environment: for a given trait and a given population of
        genotypes, the heritability will be high in some environments and low in other
        environments. If the particular environment has a differential effect upon the
        trait in individual members of the population, heritability will be low. If the
        environment does not have much differential effect upon individuals with
        respect to this trait, the trait will be highly heritable. Heritability is just
        as much a measure of the environment, or the range of environments in which a
        tested population has developed, as it is of anything else.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>Heritability
        also depends upon the population. A given trait may be found to have different <span
                class=SpellE>heritabilities</span> for different strains, breeds, races, or
        gene pools, even under the same range of environmental conditions. It is a
        measure that applies only within a gene pool, and has nothing to do with
        explaining between-group variance. An attempt to use heritability estimates in
        accounting for racial differences in any trait is, put simply, a hoax.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>Finally,
        heritability depends upon the trait. This is a more significant point than
        merely that some traits are highly heritable while others are not. A trait is simply
        some measurable characteristic in which individuals differ. What is measured,
        and the way in which it is measured, determine the heritability of a given
        population in a given environment.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>
        <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>
    </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><span style='color:green'>Indictment of the schools</span></b></p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>Each of these
        three points has been ignored by the majority of disputants on both sides of
        the IQ controversy. The first point alone should have ruled heritability
        studies out of court for any decision regarding educability. If IQ and school
        achievement have high heritability among present-day Americans, this may be
        considered an indictment of American schools. Our schools, and our society in
        general, are not making much of a difference in the kind of skills tested by
        either achievement or IQ tests. Children who go to school know more than those
        who do not, but the quality of particular schools, and of other supposedly
        educational experiences in the lives of children, do not make much difference
        among their test scores (Jencks, 1972; Kaye, 1973a). Both IQ and school
        achievement can be best predicted by knowing who a child’s parents are. But
        this tells us nothing about either educability or heritability in another sort
        of environment. There is every reason to assume that in some other society the
        quality of schooling would make a difference, and thus heritability would be
        lower.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>As my
        colleagues have pointed out, the parental variables that predict IQ are by no
        means all genetic variables. In all of the IQ heritability studies, chiefly by
        correlation among consanguineous relatives and between adopted-out twins, the
        common prenatal and similar postnatal environments grossly inflate heritability
        estimates beyond the true genotypic variance. But even if this were not the
        case -- if we had perfect measures of true heritability -- then heritability would be
        an inverse function of the relative effectiveness of a given environment.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>The second
        point is that we can estimate (from a sample) heritability only for a
        particular population or gene pool. This, too, has been largely ignored in the
        controversy. A number of authors, including Jensen (1972), have been at great
        pains to argue that there is every reason to assume IQ is equally heritable
        among blacks as among whites. But that is off the point. Neither the
        heritability within one gene pool nor within the other gene pool has anything
        to do with the mean difference in IQ between the two populations. It is
        perfectly possible, indeed quite common, for a trait to be highly heritable in
        two or more groups, that is for the within-group variance to be accounted for
        genetically, while the between-group variance is entirely due to environmental
        differences. This is true whenever we compare two cornfields that have been
        irrigated differently. It would also be true if we divided a group of children
        in half alphabetically, and fed to one half of them the answers to IQ test
        items. The heritability of IQ in the A-M group would still be the same as that
        in the N-Z group and would probably be high, yet one group would be one or more
        standard deviations superior to the other, entirely for experiential reasons. </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>There is no
        contradiction between my first and second points. Our society could be, and
        apparently is, ineffectual at making much of a difference among children within
        gene pools, within social classes and racial groups, while at the same time it
        is very effective at discriminating between the major groups.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>Third,
        heritability depends upon the measured trait. We must constantly remind each
        other that we are talking about IQ, not intelligence. Intelligence can be
        defined in many ways and measured in many more, and each way of measuring it
        must be considered a different (though not independent) trait. The trait whose
        heritability has been so exhaustingly debated is IQ, the score on a certain
        type of test. Even if we were concerned with a single gene pool and an
        inexorable environment, we would still have to examine the nature of the IQ
        tests in order to understand and interpret the heritability of this trait.</p>

    </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><span style='color:green'>Test bias</span></b></p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>Elsewhere I
        have tried to describe the systematic biases built into IQ tests, their
        historical development and current dangers (Kaye, 1973b). This has also been
        dealt with in detail by others (e.g. <span class=SpellE>Cronbach</span>, 1975).
        There are a few points worth reiterating briefly. Most important is that the
        tests discriminate between all and only those groups between which the test
        makers wanted to discriminate. IQ tests do not discriminate between boys and
        girls because, after girls were found to be consistently superior on the 1916
        Stanford-<span class=SpellE>Binet</span>, certain items were eliminated from
        the test until girls scored no higher than boys. The same sort of fiddling is
        possible, and has been successfully done, to eliminate racial differences in IQ
        scores. But the resulting tests were not adopted since they failed to predict
        school achievement (<span class=SpellE>Eells</span> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>et al.</i>, 1951). The gross differences in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>achievement</i> between black and white children had to be accounted
        for by corresponding differences on a supposedly objective test.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>Another
        important way in which the tests were fiddled with was by eliminating items and
        subtests that contributed to instability of IQs over time. Thus what was
        originally an hypothesis, that each individual’s growth in ‘mental age’ was a
        constant function of his chronological age, became self-fulfilling. The test
        was constructed so that IQs would be relatively constant. This meant
        eliminating items which tested skills and knowledge upon whose development the
        environment made a difference. Inevitably this would create a trait with
        relatively high heritability. If differences in experience made a difference in
        the acquisition of some skill, within the population on which IQ tests were
        standardized, then that skill was dropped from the battery of skills included
        in the test. Thus the genotypic variation within the population was allowed to play
        a greater role than the environmental variation. However, this
        stability-increasing and heritability-increasing procedure was only applied <i
                style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>within</i> the standardization sample. It
        did not have the effect of eliminating items for which the experience of most
        white children prepared them better than did the experience of most black
        children. In other words, precisely the situation that I said was possible, in
        hypothetical examples of cornfields or alphabetically grouped children, did
        indeed prevail in the construction and standardization of IQ tests.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>There is a
        basic difference between tests of the IQ or ‘aptitude’ type and tests of
        achievement. In the latter type, items are included just because the test
        makers or some policy-making body regards them as important items of knowledge,
        whether for driving a car, programming a computer, or going on to a more
        advanced subject. In the IQ-type tests, on the other hand, items may have no
        face validity at all; their inclusion on the test is due to the fact that they
        contribute to total scores that meet the desired criteria of normal
        distribution and stability. There are similarities between the two types of
        test; in fact, achievement tests are often nationally standardized so that they
        acquire some of the worst features of ‘aptitude’ tests. But in principle an
        achievement test is potentially capable of telling us something about the
        strengths and weaknesses of individuals in different subjects. IQ scores can
        never provide such information (though the individual child’s response to the
        IQ testing situation is often used creatively for a clinical diagnosis).</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><span style='color:green'>Effects of the IQ tests on research</span></b></p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>What effects
        has the existence of IQ tests had upon research in education and developmental
        psychology? First, it has perpetuated certain myths about the nature of
        learning and intelligence. I mentioned the fact that what was initially an
        hypothesis, that ‘mental age’ bears a constant relation to chronological age,
        quickly became an assumption that could no longer be tested. The tests were
        constructed in such a way that most children’s IQs typically were fairly
        constant. In fact the notion of ‘mental age’ lost its meaning. Since the 1940s,
        IQs have not been quotients at all, but simply scores read out of a table in
        the test manual. The table is constructed so as to yield nearly-perfect
        distributions at each age. Unfortunately the smoothness of these curves, and of
        various forms of stability curves for IQ, tend to be interpreted as proving
        that there is something fixed, determined, and innate about human intelligence.
        The almost universal misrepresentation and misunderstanding of heritability
        compounds the problem. And as perhaps the worst consequence of all, the
        entrenched establishment of <span class=SpellE>psychometricians</span> and the
        test publishing industry (over 200 million standardized tests per year, or four
        per child in the
        <st1:country-region w:st="on">
            <st1:place w:st="on">United
                States
            </st1:place>
        </st1:country-region>
        ) continually retard the prospects for
        investment in research into alternative conceptions of intelligence.
    </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>A second sort
        of effect has to do with the notion of ‘upping’ IQs. At some point in history,
        educators bought the myth that if children were <span class=GramE>educable,</span>
        it ought to be possible to raise their IQ scores. This would mean, essentially,
        that IQ tests were nothing other than achievement tests. They do test
        achievement in the sense that the items require information acquired from
        experience, and as I have said, a group of children whose experiences have been
        more closely oriented to the types of knowledge required on the IQ test will
        indeed ‘achieve’ higher scores than children with different kinds of
        experience. Nonetheless it remains true that an IQ test is the worst possible
        kind of test by which to measure achievement, whether one is concerned about
        the acquisition of important skills or the more general question whether children
        are educable. IQ tests are explicitly designed to be unresponsive to school
        experiences of varying quality. Therefore the studies that have successfully
        boosted the IQ scores of <span class=SpellE>Headstart</span> or other children
        are all the more remarkable; the vast number of studies that found negligible
        or only temporary effects on IQ are simply meaningless. Well-meaning educators
        who accept the assignment of trying to boost IQs are taking on an Augean task.
        It is a Sisyphean task as well, for boosting the IQs of some children
        automatically lowers the IQs of an equal number of children as soon as the
        tests are <span class=SpellE>restandardized</span>.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>Finally, there
        is tracking. IQ tests together with other tests constructed in much the same
        way are the principal means of dividing<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>schoolchildren into tracks or streams. The justification for this
        widespread practice (beginning in the first grade in 20% of American school
        systems and by the eighth grade in 80%; Findley and Bryan, 1970) is that
        children supposedly learn more in homogeneous groups. Yet there is no adequate research
        indicating that any children learn more in homogeneous groups; there is some
        evidence that poorly-achieving children do worse; and there are clear
        indications that self-esteem and motivation suffer in the ‘lower’ streams. The
        popular belief that tracking defends poorly-achieving children from invidious
        comparisons with their betters has never received the slightest empirical
        support. One thing we do know is that segregating high-IQ from low-IQ children
        makes the prediction of school achievement by IQ a self-fulfilling prophecy.
        There is even some possibility that this practice aids and abets the stability
        of IQ scores, thus contributing to the perpetuation of the myth, but the
        evidence on this is not yet clear (Jencks, 1972).</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>A number of
        current educational innovations involve homogeneous grouping of pupils in one
        way or another. Chief among these is mastery learning, the attractive approach
        that allocates time and resources where they are most needed to bring the
        maximum number of pupils to some criterion, instead of moving the whole class
        along from one unit to the next while individual children fall further and
        further behind (Bloom, 1974). In grouping of this type, however, the tests used
        are necessarily achievement tests. Unlike tracking, the mastery tests and
        mastery groups are done independently for each school subject, so that a child
        can spend more in arithmetic and less time in reading. And there is constant
        retesting, rather than an irreversible decision being made in the ninth, or the
        fifth, or even the first grade.</p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:27.0pt'>These mundane
        matters seem to have taken us far from the cleanliness of philosophy. Yet there
        is no clear boundary at which we could have stopped. Our purest conceptions
        about human intelligence and development are inseparable from the research
        paradigms and instruments we use. These in turn are inseparable from the
        applied questions that guide the research, and the policy questions are
        inseparable from the society’s values and myths, which finally reduce to the
        purest conceptions about human development. Some of the critics of tracking, IQ
        testing, and heritability research have suggested that there is something
        un-American about them, that they conflict with our egalitarian ideals. I
        personally see these practices and the research as very American, ideologically
        speaking; as the resolution of two conflicting ideals. We are said to believe,
        on the one hand, in equal opportunity and self-determination. Yet we clearly
        believe in the supremacy and inheritance of property. We need a device by which
        to guarantee the succession of children to their parents’ status and earning
        power, while making it look as though they are succeeding by merit. That has
        been effectively accomplished by IQ testing, by tracking, and by the research
        purporting to investigate intelligence. This is the context in which science
        exists. Against this background, and yet in the abstract, please: tell us what
        distinguishes good science from bad.</p>
