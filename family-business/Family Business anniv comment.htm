<p><b><i><span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>Hope
springs eternal</span></i></b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>Decades
of research have not stopped families from going into business with unrealistic
assumptions.</span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>The invitation to reflect on how our field has
changed over 20 years stumped me, at first. (By “our” field, I mean family/business
dynamics, and more narrowly: resolving chronic conflicts.)</span></p>

<p><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>In an age of mind-boggling technological,
geopolitical and environmental change, we tend to forget that there are timeless
constants in human life. Written history going back at least 3,000 years shows
that family members are no more likely to change the ways they enter into
business relationships than couples are to change the ways they fall in love,
marry or make babies: largely irrationally.</span></p>

<p><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>Experienced consultants&apos; warnings are no more
likely to stop family members going into business for the wrong reasons, or
with unrealistic assumptions destined for conflict, than humans are to
eliminate war, knavery or population explosions. We old-timers may have learned
to see sooner and more efficiently where to intervene: when to apply the
reframes, transferences and eye-opening exercises of both family therapy and
individual psychological assessment and counseling. But as is true of so many
professions, I&apos;m not sure we&apos;ve become better at shortening that learning curve
for newcomers to the field. </span></p>

<p><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Less
dogmatic</span></b><span style='font-family:Calibri'> </span></p>

<p><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>It&apos;s my impression that those of us who have been
preaching mental health to family firms for years are less certain about
general principles than when we had few cases under our belts. I suspect most
of us preach <i>fewer</i> dogmatic <i>do</i>s and <i>don&apos;t</i>s than we did 20
years ago to guide a founder when hiring a son or daughter, or contemplating
the transfer of ownership, or giving the in-laws votes on a family council. </span></p>

<p><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>Longtime participants in the annual conference on
Psychodynamics of Family Business, for example, discuss cases more in terms of
a process of discovering the unique intervention that may help a particular
family system at a particular stage, than a checklist of factors thought to be
healthy vs. risky. For example, Kim Schneider Malek says the Schneider
Consulting Group now uses the “three circle” distinctions among ownership,
family and management sectors more as a tool for<em><span style='font-family:
Calibri'> discovering with </span></em>clients how to frame the different roles
in each unique family system than as a matter of <em><span style='font-family:
Calibri'>bringing education</span></em><i> to</i> them.</span></p>

<p><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>Another example: In an early column in this
magazine, I asserted that resolving family conflict was critically different
from settling disputes between unrelated parties. I now see that what
sociologists call “incompatible narratives” between nations or communities can
similarly trap <i>relatives</i> into hopelessly rigid positions, even when they
care about one another and long for familial closeness. Like warring religious
groups or cultures anywhere in the world, they can&apos;t compromise without giving
up deeply held beliefs about their characters, histories and moral
justifications. </span></p>

<p><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>Take the case of a son who needs more money and
desires more authority than his father is prepared to cede. The son&apos;s arguments
are based on promises he believes were made to him and rewards denied to him
over many years. Unwilling to negotiate win/win outcomes based on present
circumstances, shared goals and compromises, his father gets defensive about
the past and recites his own tale of disappointment going back to the son&apos;s
dismal performance since middle school. With such incompatible narratives, the
son will never convince Dad to acknowledge having cheated him for decades. We
have a “that&apos;s my story and I&apos;m sticking to it” situation. Alike,
unfortunately, each demands a win/lose outcome, to vindicate past wrongs.
Rarely will they achieve anything but lose/lose unless, perhaps, we learn to
adapt versions of the lengthy reconciliation processes that succeeded in South Africa and Northern Ireland.</span></p>

<p><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Small
changes can make a difference</span></b></p>

<p><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>In short, I can&apos;t say whether we in the family
business dynamics field are more effective dispensers of conflict-reducing
medicine than we were 20 years ago. I know we&apos;re not as effective as we hope to
be. Human beings change only a little, and slowly. Any alteration in behavior
meets new resistance, within the self as well as from those with whom one lives
or works. Fortunately, the consequences of small changes in individual behavior
can make a significant difference to the success of a team, so it sometimes
requires only modest individual changes (and the desire for a shared narrative)
to produce gradual systemic progress.</span></p>

<p><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>Hope springs eternal, and family members will
continue to enter into business partnerships as long as there are people on our
planet. As with marriage and procreation, if rational judgment plays a role in
their determination to take on these known challenges, so does a hefty dose of
denial.            </span></p>
