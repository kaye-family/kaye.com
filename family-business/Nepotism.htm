style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>By Adam Bellow.</span>
<span class=GramE>Random House, 2003.</span></b></p>

<p><b>Reviewed for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Family Business Review</i>, 2009</b></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>&#8220;What kind of
society is this, where you&#8217;re afraid to appoint your nephew or your son
or your relative, for fear of what might be said?!?&#8221; <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Chicago</st1:City></st1:place>&#8217;s Richard J. Daley (father of
the present mayor) famously screamed at his City Council. That must be the only
omission from this book, whose author surveys three thousand years of anecdotal
cases about the generational continuity of power and influence. </span></p>

<p>Adam Bellow defines nepotism as &#8220;altruism limited to
family members&#8221;&#8212;a form of discrimination, in other words, as
opposed to earned status based on talent, effort, and devotion to the public
good. Like the inimitable Mayor Daley, he wants to defend the family value of
nepotism against &#8220;the extreme contempt&#8221; in which he feels it is
held by many others.</p>

<p>Bellow asserts that nepotism, in that broad sense of
successful people greasing the wheels of advancement for their kin, got a bad
name over the millennia, but that it has evolved into a healthy thing for the
American polity. It&#8217;s not clear where he sees a serious controversy, nor
whether the diverse forms of family advancement he lumps together have enough
in common to generalize about. Public officials appointing family members to
lucrative positions ahead of more qualified applicants always attract critics,
but what does that have to do with a popular Senator appearing at his
nephew&#8217;s campaign rally in a free election for a seat in Congress from
another state? Much less an owner hiring a son or daughter in their
family-owned business? </p>

<p>Given the fact that some children of public servants, like
those of artists, athletes, scientists, and entrepreneurs, will inherit genetic
advantages similar to the parents&#8217;, as well as being exposed to the tools
and the norms of those trades from an early age, many of the author&#8217;s
examples merely show non-random choices of profession, rather than nepotism by
any definition.</p>

<p>Bellow says in his introduction, but fails to establish with
evidence in more than five hundred densely printed pages (more words, one
suspects, than any two of his father&#8217;s novels), what we have now in
America is a &#8220;New Nepotism,&#8221; somehow a blend of the best elements
of aristocracy and meritocracy.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Reviews of the book ranged from dismissing it as an
amateur&#8217;s compilation of historical anecdotes lacking cogency or
significance to &#8220;a must read for anyone involved in a family
business.&#8221; Whoever reads it for the latter reason is sure to be disappointed,
full of engaging stories as it is.</p>

<p>Asserting a generalization doesn&#8217;t make it true, let
alone useful. Bellow claims, &#8220;The American political class is
increasingly filled with the offspring of political families.&#8221; On the
contrary, almost half the book details multigenerational political families
from Colonial America through the offspring of Jack, Bobby, and Teddy. It seems
to have been a constant rather than increasing.</p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>&#8220;No social
scientist has studied this phenomenon. But you don&#8217;t need a degree in
sociology to realize that the boom in generational succession is something new
in scope and character.&#8221; Actually, you do; at least you need systematic
historical or journalistic research, testing propositions against evidence.</p>

<p>Instead of supporting his broad assertions, Bellow wanders
through anthropology, evolutionary biology (&#8220;the purest case of nepotism
in nature is that of the cellular slime mold&#8221;), and comparative religion.
Is the importance of kinship in hunter-gatherer tribes relevant? Perhaps, but
not when treated superficially. And it&#8217;s a stretch to assume that a
survey of the 15<sup>th</sup> century <span class=SpellE>Borgias</span>&#8217;
nepotism has anything to teach us about political or business succession in 21<sup>st</sup>
century <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
</p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='color:green'>Does nepotism in politics have much to do with family firms
or their succession?</span></b></p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>Family business
successors differ from all the other beneficiaries of &#8220;altruism toward
kin&#8221; that Bellow describes, in that the owning family is perfectly
entitled to appoint them. It&#8217;s not depriving others in the community,
state, or country of their fair shot at controlling that family-owned business
or inheriting that family&#8217;s wealth</p>

<p>The word nepotism (nephew-ism, originally referring to
several centuries of licentious popes&#8217; &#8220;nephews&#8221;) only exists
to cover the kind of preferment that is illegitimate or unfair. The continuity
question in families we work with is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>which</i>
family members, among those legitimately entitled, will be selected to lead;
which others will help them carry the enterprise forward for another
generation; and which ones will go off in other directions. </p>

<p>Bellow touches on that in a paragraph about the impact of
Old Testament stories on Western conceptions of the family:</p>

<p>&#8220;Unlike the civilizations of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>, Africa, or <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the Bible offers a realistic
image of family life that &#8230; affords no guarantee of harmony, loyalty, or
even affection. Instead, from the beginning, the family is presented as a
setting of competition, envy, even murder: the source of our greatest passions
and the locus of our greatest sins. It is the dynamism of this patriarchal
family, full of competitive siblings, jealous wives, and rebellious sons, that
drives the action of the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>How little has changed, and how much more significant are
the questions that come to mind about all that competition, as opposed to the
mere fact of generational succession. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Of
course</i> people try to advance their offspring and their relatives when they
can. How well or how poorly is that goal served in various circumstances, by
the competitive processes involved, both rational and emotional?</p>

<p>The case of John Adams is particularly interesting for the
internal battle he fought between political philosophy and his nepotistic
impulses. Bellow&#8217;s ten pages on this founding father, a fine summary,
will be familiar to readers of David McCullough&#8217;s biography or viewers of
the HBO series based on it. It does have relevance to family business, both
because we can see parallels to a subgroup of our clients and because <st1:place
w:st="on">Adams</st1:place> would be an extreme case even among those. </p>

<p>Bellow quotes this astonishing letter: </p>

<p>&#8220;I will not bear the reproaches of my children. I
will tell them that I studied and labored to procure a free constitution of
government for them to solace themselves under, and if they do not prefer this
to ample fortune, to ease and elegance, they are not my children, and I care
not what becomes of them. They shall live upon thin diet, wear mean clothes,
and work hard with cheerful hearts and free spirits, or they may be the
children of the earth, or of no one, for me.&#8221;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Principled words, not by Lenin but our second President. Yet
inconsistent, we learn, with the reality of <st1:place w:st="on">Adams</st1:place>&#8217;s
paternal relations. He advanced his eldest son, the first of our four dynastic
successors to the Presidency, at the expense of his two other sons. When
Charles drank himself to death, &#8220;his father the president refused to see
him. &#8230; He was denied burial in the family crypt, and the <st1:place
w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Adamses</span></st1:place> never spoke of him
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Missing from Bellow&#8217;s book is an awareness that the
desire to preserve wealth is much more than the desire to advance one&#8217;s
children&#8217;s security, careers and influence. John Adams&#8217;s behavior
appears less hypocritical, though no less harsh, if we see his favoritism in
the light of how &#8220;good son&#8221; and &#8220;bad son&#8221; reflected on
himself&#8212;their altruism toward him, in other words, not his toward them.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on"><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='color:green'>Darwin</span></b></st1:place></st1:City><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='color:green'> in the
boardroom?</span></b></p>

<p>Bellow&#8217;s tangent into theories of evolution (classing
nepotism among the things parents of every species do to promote the success of
their genes) is silly. It applies least of all to a business owner, the spread
of whose genes depends entirely on the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>number</i>
of his progeny rather than on which of them, if any, carry on the business.</p>

<p>Actually, competition and survival of the fittest are pervasive
forces <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>within</i> successful families.
Business advisors and researchers, as well as family members, are more struck
by those competitive dynamics and their consequences than by the fact that
parents try to promote their clan as a whole.</p>

<p>In a competition for family business succession, if the
fittest to lead succeeds without actually murdering his or her competitors for
the top job, it has no effect on the founder&#8217;s genes. It does help his <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-biological</i> legacy survive: the
business. So, if parents assert control over the choice of successors, it must
be either because they believe the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>business
</i>will be fitter to survive under particular children&#8217;s leadership or
because they&#8217;re more concerned about what&#8217;s best for different
children. Either way, it is their <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>personal</i>
legacy not their genes they&#8217;re promoting. So it makes no sense to talk
about nepotism as a biological phenomenon in this connection. Human thought
long since supplanted the force of the selfish gene, in favor of emotional
attachment to legacy institutions.</p>

<p>When the author gets around to making assertions about
different methods that <span class=SpellE>nepotists</span> employ (&#8220;the
nepotistic arts&#8221; as he nicely puts it), he is still lumping business,
politics, and philanthropic institutions together. A serious book exclusively
about family firms&#8217; favoritism versus meritocracy would go beyond the
obvious. Yes, parents try to use their resources to promote the welfare of
their progeny (the businesses and foundations they create, not only their
children and grandchildren). That fact leads to questions that don&#8217;t
appear in this book: What roles do the processes of competition within families
play in selecting leaders? How effective are they in achieving the various
goals of wealth creators (long-term family financial security, survival of the
legacy business, social causes, etc.)?</p>

<p>Are there typical paths that next generation members take
when not selected for leadership, paths for those who stay active within the
FOB as compared with those who pursue lives in other directions? How much of
each kind of family capital do they take with them? Where the answer to that is
&#8220;less than their numerical share,&#8221; parental favoritism isn&#8217;t
always, or even usually, responsible for the inequality. Often it is simply the
parents&#8217; belief that survival of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>business</i>
is the higher calling, necessitating or deserving the greater share of
resources.</p>
