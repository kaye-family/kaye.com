    <P>Ken Kaye's award-winning article in <I>Family Business Review</I> entitled "Penetrating the Cycle of Sustained Conflict" is often quoted and has been reprinted twice in collections of essential resources for family business owners and advisors. In that article and several shorter ones, Ken explains that conflicts with families are unlike those that occur between unrelated parties. The latter want to settle their dispute and have nothing further to do with each other; whereas the aim of family dispute resolution is to have <I>better</I> future relationships.</P>
    <P>Ken's 1994 book <I>Workplace Wars and How to End Them</I> describes our systematic approach to resolving conflict in groups of people who need to improve their working relationships. Chapter 7 explains that a Conflict Resolving System is an essential part of team building. When families, organizations, or small work teams are confident that they know how to address conflict constructively, it's a positive opportunity for change. Our job is not just to eliminate conflict from our clients' lives. It is to change the organizational culture so that future conflicts are resolved without our help.</P>
    <P>We start by exploring which goals are shared, which goals are unique to different members but are not incompatible, and which ones are really conflicting goals. The next phase is to clear up misunderstandings, practice active listening, and find any differences among team members which ought to be strengths (complementary skills or diverse points of view) as opposed to genuine problems. Then we take up the challenge of shifting people away from mutual blaming and on to a commitment to change their own behavior.</P>
    <P>A fourth phase becomes necessary if people are stuck: either unable to make good on their commitments or unwilling to take the risk. Finally (and, frankly, sometimes as the last resort), we'll coach individuals in what they can do unilaterally, without waiting for their teammates or family members to change.</P>
    <P>Virtually all our engagements involve a combination of individual interviews, full-team retreats, and small-group problem-solving sessions. Sometimes it's also worth using informal indicators such as the Myers-Briggs or more elaborate testing, either to understand an individual's difficulties or to serve as a springboard for group self-assessment.</P>
    <P>If you'd like to <A HREF="mailto:ken@kaye.com">tell us</A> anonymously about the conflict you're struggling with, we can give you an idea how we'd suggest approaching it. (No one will see your message except Ken, with the same confidentiality as if you were a client.)</P>
