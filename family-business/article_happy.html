        <h2>Happy Landings: The Opportunity to Fly Again</h2><i>Kenneth Kaye, Ph.D.</i><br><br><br>

        <p><b>Summary: </b><i>The success of a business for its owners is measurable in terms of the opportunities it
            creates for their beneficiaries. Perpetuating that business is only one of many possible opportunities for
            them.</P>
        </i><br>
        </h3><p>Reportedly, as many as a quarter to a third of viable U.S. businesses remain in the same families from
        one generation to the next. That is a remarkably high number; not a poor record at all. Yet, if the vast
        majority of family businesses are not destined for that kind of transition, what are we experts doing for <I>them</I>?
        Are we doing a disservice by our almost obsessive focus on the succession process?</P>
        <p>Too many families can't bring themselves to get <I>out</I> of a business when they no longer have capable and
            motivated leadership, or to get unsuited family members out of the business when their relationship with it
            or each other jeopardizes everything. I have written about chronic conflict (Kaye, 1991), about &quot;prisoners
            of the family business&quot; (Kaye, 1992), and about families' unhealthy relationships with business (Kaye,
            1996). With due respect to the many healthy family firms, this article proposes a conceptual change, a
            research agenda, and a consulting orientation toward family functioning and <I>opportunity</I> rather than
            succession. </P>
        <p></P>
        <h3><p>Family Business Success Means Opportunity Building</P>
        </h3>
        <p>The ultimate success of a family business can be defined identically to the success of any parent: gauged by
            the <I>value added to next-generation opportunity</I>. Parents, by nature, want to find or create
            opportunities for their children, enabling the latter to start their adult lives with advantages over other
            young adults in the same society. That is why a common measure of how well parents have done is how much
            they have <I>increased</I> their children's socioeconomic standing, relative to where they themselves
            started two or three decades earlier. </P>
        <p>This definition refers to opportunities created for all children in any family; regardless of gender,
            intellect, proclivities, or gifts. In the case of a business-owning family, it would apply to those who
            don't enter the business as well as those who do.</P>
        <p>Successful parents may provide advantages of many kinds, including:</P>
        <p></P>
        <h4><p>External Advantages</P>
        </h4>
        <p>a profitable, already viable business</P>
        <p>a professional degree</P>
        <p>investment capital</P>
        <p>a network of social connections</P>
        <p>freedom</P>
        <p></P>
        <h4><p>Internal Advantages</P>
        </h4>
        <p>physical health</P>
        <p>mental health and good judgment</P>
        <p>positive self-esteem</P>
        <p>moral principles and sound practices</P>
        <p>technical know-how</P>
        <p></P>
        <p>Driven by biological instincts, most parents try to give their offspring as many of those competitive
            advantages as possible. Entrepreneurial success creates diverse opportunities, most of which are better
            accessed with cash (for postgraduate tuition, travel, investment, politics, philanthropy, financial
            independence, etc.) than by the inside track to a job in the family business. In short, family success does
            not necessarily entail retaining ownership of a business.</P>
        <p>Confining the discussion to family enterprises in which the next generation does become active, Table 1
            offers a perspective on success that transcends the question of succession. </P>
        <p>From that perspective, successful consultation means liberating individuals or whole families from any of the
            failure conditions listed on the right side of Table 1, and maximizing their chances of achieving the full
            list of criteria on the left. If the business does stay in the family and/or if family members stay in the
            business, educators and advisors ought to do our utmost to ensure that we're really helping to transfer
            opportunity rather than its opposite: entrapment. That should be the responsibility of a family's legal and
            financial advisors as much as it is that of psychological advisors; especially since relatively few have
            psychological advisors, while nearly all have legal and financial counsel. </P>
        <p>An example of consulting failure can be found in fifth-generation Hasbin Molding Co., controlled by the widow
            of the founder's grandson. Her two children, Buddy and Shirley, ran the company; each was divorced and had
            three adult children. Three of those six fifth-generation members were employed in the business, as well as
            the spouse of one. Buddy was the hands-on manufacturing vice president, which really meant plant manager.
            Shirley had the title of sales vice president, but she actually functioned as president in all respects but
            one: Neither Buddy nor his son, a machinist, took any direction from her. </P>
        <p>Shirley's two sons were the company's principal salesmen. Although they worked hard, Buddy wasn't convinced
            of their worth. He cited numerous examples of how they were getting a &quot;free ride.&quot; As if bent on
            proving their uncle's point, at the time our consultation began, the two young men had defied their
            grandmother by flying first class instead of coach on a business trip to Hong Kong. Shirley wasn't happy
            about her sons' flagrant disregard of company policy, but she was incensed about Buddy's accusations. He had
            bullied her as a child, his alcoholism had ruined family life, and </P>

        <p>Note. Adapted from Kaye, 1996, p. 356)</P>
        <p>he continued to be verbally abusive and demeaning despite ten years of sobriety. Buddy and Shirley agreed on
            almost nothing, the company was going nowhere, but Mrs. Hasbin refused to discuss selling it and refused to
            proceed with estate planning until her family proved they could work together harmoniously.</P>
        <p>Buddy and Shirley did agree on one thing: There was no way they or their sons could work together in the
            future. I failed, however, to convince them that an assertive united front on that one point would more
            effectively persuade their mother than the power struggles that only served to maintain their problems. The
            company attorney, whose firm had doubled as Mrs. Hasbin's estate counsel, failed to use their 20-year
            relationship to budge her from her angry position. She feared that if she sold the company or allowed either
            Buddy or Shirley to exchange stock for other assets, she would lose her power over their paychecks and
            thereby her control over their unhappy lives and what little control she had over her grandchildren as well.
            That was true.</P>
        <p></P>
        <h3><p>The Happy Landings Metaphor</P>
            </h3P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In aviation, every aircraft is in the process of landing from the moment it takes off.
            The force of lift produced by motion of its wings through the air merely postpones its fall. The pilot's
            work is all aimed at bringing the aircraft down at the optimal place and time&mdash;instead of returning to Earth
            in a less desirable place, time, or condition. So with any human enterprise: The question is not whether it
            will survive in perpetuity but when, where, and how it will terminate. <I>How</I> is even more important
            than when and where: An unscheduled landing at an alternate airport preserves all the capital assets
            (financial, intellectual, and human), so they can be used again for another trip. An unrelenting effort to
            reach their planned destination may put safe alternates out of reach, and thus destroy all those assets.</P>
            <p>The analogy may help to clarify what should be the job of family business educators, researchers, and
                consultants alike. It is to help owners recognize when the time comes to redirect or terminate their
                &quot;flight.&quot; Sooner or later, every business-owning family (if not in this generation than in the
                next or the next), needs help looking for the best place, time, and manner to land safely.</P>
            <h3><p>Research Agenda</P>
            </h3>
            <p>In order to fulfill that function responsibly, we need much better answers than we currently have, to two
                sets of questions. </P>
            <p>The first set involves predicting where things are headed under various scenarios. I won't belabor the
                airplane analogy because, unfortunately, we experts on family business are closer to astrological
                forecasters than to aviators or scientists as yet. For example, when clients asked, &quot;What happens
                if next-generation leaders of a family business try to share the CEO function equally among two or three
                siblings, in-laws, or cousins?&quot; I used to say with as much expert authority as I could muster,
                &quot;It won't work.&quot; More recently, I've heard myself saying, &quot;It depends on a number of
                factors ....&quot; The bald truth would be, &quot;I don't know.&quot; So, too, with questions about
                nonworking siblings' stock ownership, the importance of outside experience before entering the family
                business, the size of firms requiring a &quot;real&quot; board, and so forth. </P>
            <p>Most of us realize that research on questions like those is currently insufficient. At least our young
                field has built the institutional support for such research, which may take another decade to reach a
                critical mass that one could call a genuine body of knowledge. The second set of questions, however, has
                barely begun to be asked; and I think they are just as critical.</P>
            <p>This second set of questions deals with human beings' persistence in holding on to family enterprises
                that are clearly failing on the criteria of Table 1; enterprises that we can see <I>aren't</I> providing
                many external or internal advantages for the next generation and actually seem to be eroding their
                opportunities. There is a direct analogy to aviation psychology, because the latter field, too, has yet
                to discover the answer to this question: &quot;What leads an intelligent, experienced (non-airline)
                pilot to fly on into worsening weather conditions when running out of fuel, fatigued, and with known
                equipment malfunctions?&quot; From the point of view of human psychology, the answer in both domains may
                turn out to be the same.</P>
            <p>Why the resistance to letting go&mdash;of unhappy family members, of the business itself? The author's
                consulting sample (Kaye, 1996, discussed below) shows how strong this resistance is. But why?</P>
            <p>When patients are treated for a mental illness, their families, physicians, and health maintenance
                organizations expect to know the scientific basis for their particular diagnosis and treatment plan. In
                our field, there hasn't been any research at all, as yet, that could provide a scientific basis for
                saying, &quot;Family business A has what it takes to pass to the next generation; Family B's problems
                are not fixable; Family C's problems can be solved by taking steps <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, and <I>z</I>.&quot;
                Of course, we do make statements like those and we are often right&mdash;but we cannot long continue without a
                body of statistically valid research.</P>
            <p>What we do have are some good theories about individual and family development, and some concepts that
                help us think about the resistance to letting go of a family enterprise that isn't working. We need to
                test those theories. Is it <I>true</I> that some families are afraid of individuation (Kaye, 1996)?
                &quot;Individuation&quot;, or the equivalent term &quot;differentiation&quot;, means that healthy family
                members allow each other and themselves to balance their shared identity with distinct separate
                identities and purposes that may sometimes take them in different directions without jeopardizing their
                family bonds. </P>
            <p>Family business succession sometimes appears to be a means of resisting individuation&mdash;as though chasing a
                parent's dream were the only way to maintain family bonds. That, in turn, intensifies conflict, which
                increases fears about individuation; so the problem escalates. Unfortunately, the fears may be justified
                because individuation does endanger family business survival in any family business that happens to be
                built around stifling individuation. Will systematically gathered data support or disconfirm that good
                theory? </P>
            <p>What role does ego development play in children's ability to make the break, or in parents' ability to
                accept it? For children to grow into healthy, secure individuals, their parents must have enough ego
                development to let them go. </P>
            <p>Ego development means the ability to control internal instinctual reactions and anxiety, and the external
                stress of others' explicit demands and implicit expectations. Herbert's (1989) groundbreaking study of a
                select sample offers a model for personality studies of entrepreneurs and their families, which could be
                aimed at the questions raised here. </P>
            <p>We need to know, too, what role social pressures play in people's difficulties about terminating family
                firms. Are there cultural variables that make some families define success in terms of business
                ownership and family participation? Surprisingly, films, novels, and theater have portrayed negative
                images for centuries&mdash;family business as an unhealthy trap, a spoiler of children, or a home for
                ne'er-do-wells. Why, then, do we still see so many families equating success with succession?</P>
            <p>A research question for anthropologists, perhaps, is whether human beings have innate feelings about the
                family enterprise as the archetype of pre-industrial life. Could there be an <I>instinctual</I> drive to
                keep business and family inseparable?</P>
            <p>Finally, to what extent do professional advisors (of all disciplines) encourage succession planning and
                warn against &quot;failing&quot; to perpetuate a family business? When this happens, is it because we
                envy the client's wealth and power, and can't imagine anyone not wanting to be Dwayne Andreas? Or are we
                merely reflecting what prospective clients want to hear instead of challenging their assumptions?</P>
            <p></P>
            <h3><p>Consulting Orientation</P>
            </h3>
            <p>The Family Firm Institute should make us sign a pledge <I>not</I> to make facilitating family business
                succession our professional mission. Succession can be a failure, when it occurs as a result of
                developmental failure in a family. Conversely, a thoroughly successful outcome for a family business may
                be the decision to dispose of it (Le Van, 1998; Tagiuri and Davis, 1996). </P>
            <p>The key for consultants is to beware the assumption that something is wrong with people who don't &quot;succeed&quot;
                at succession&mdash;and something right, by definition, with those who do. Frequently, insurance and estate
                planners bemoan their clients who commission wonderful plans but don't execute them: What's wrong with
                those people, the advisors wonder, that stops them from doing the presumably successful thing? Could it
                be that the &quot;best laid plan&quot; is wrong? Could it be that deep down the client knows it isn't
                good for the family?</P>
            <p>As reported in Kaye (1996), a family dynamics (psychology or organizational development) consultant can
                group family firms according to whether they possess the necessary ingredients for a transition to
                currently active successors (about a quarter of the author's practice, with whom our &quot;success rate&quot;
                runs close to 100%), or the ingredients would be present if one or more members can first be liberated
                from destructive positions and attitudes (about two fifths of this practice, with only about a 33%
                success rate), or the would-be successors simply aren't capable of working together for a promising
                transition (about a third of my clients). &quot;Success&quot; in the latter case would mean helping the
                family take positive steps toward terminating their shared business ownership. By that definition, I am
                successful with only about 10% of that group (Kaye, 1996). Shouldn't our goal as a profession be to
                improve that poor success rate for &quot;happy landings&quot;? How should we educate those clients,
                reframe their goals, prepare them and counsel them?</P>
            <p>An approach that I have adopted is to focus on the word <I>opportunity</I>. I congratulate parents on the
                opportunities their success has created for the next generation, get them talking about how far the
                family has come from humble roots, and then ask the younger members how they feel about those
                opportunities. They feel appreciative, of course; though they haven't always expressed that to their
                parents. I emphasize advantages in the broadest sense, including appropriate examples of both external
                and internal advantages, with the aim of gaining all members' agreement to define success in those
                terms, regardless who winds up owning the business. Parental success means providing those opportunities
                at times when their children's lives can best capitalize on them. Inheritor success means making the
                most of those opportunities, not ruining or being ruined by them.</P>
            <p>When substantial wealth is involved, we find it helpful to discuss the major challenges ahead whether
                they keep the operating business or not (Hamilton, 1992). It is the wealth, not the business, that
                presents opportunities as well as problems, which these task-oriented entrepreneurs can sink their
                problem-solving teeth into more readily than they can think about &quot;letting go.&quot; </P>
            <p>In my experience, the families that do manage to keep their firms successfully over generations are
                mainly those that <I>don't have to do so</I>. Only those whose members have other paths on which they
                could have succeeded, alternative opportunities they were capable of taking, seem to have talents and
                experiences that make them likely to thrive in business together. Unfortunately, many families that <I>cannot</I>
                pass their enterprises successfully to the next generation are those that can least afford not
                to&mdash;because their children are ill-equipped for success elsewhere. This means that clients can benefit
                much more, the earlier they seek counsel or encounter books, articles, forum programs, and so forth.</P>
            <p>What about the succession cases? (I give them, rather than ourselves, credit for their virtually
                inevitable progress through the process.) Notwithstanding the 100% &quot;success rate,&quot; they seldom
                achieve a perfect outcome. As one client said, &quot;Yeah, of course we'll make it, but what will be the
                quality of our relationship when we're done?&quot; Rarely is it better than it was before. If the dream
                of being closer and more comfortable with each other, or of being appreciated by a son, daughter,
                parent, or sibling wasn't realized by 20 years of working together, it isn't going to happen through a
                succession process. Individuals may come to accept themselves and their families as good enough. Even
                with such modest goals, though, the quality of family relationships after business transition is a
                measure of the consultant's success. With clients whose legal/financial transitions are assured, how can
                we be satisfied with ourselves as consultants unless we also helped them wind up in a good family
                place?</P>
            <p>The role of a family business consultant should not be to increase the number of families whose firms
                survive into the next generation, but to <I>narrow</I> the number to just those whose family businesses
                enhance their lives. For that group, our role is to help them make a transition that increases the
                opportunity for all members. For others, it is to help them exchange the business for its worth in new
                opportunities.</P>
            <p></P>
            <h3><p>Conclusion</P>
            </h3>
            <p>The words <I>success</I> and <I>succession</I> are still used as synonyms--mistakenly, when family firms
                are concerned. We decry tax-driven planning, yet we are guilty of a comparable blindness if our avowed
                mission is succession-driven rather than health-driven. We should be in the business of helping
                entrepreneurs discover whether their overlapping family and business roles are good for them in the long
                run. &quot;Is this business healthy for our family? If it cramps our personal growth or hurts our
                relationships, how can we change that?&quot;</P>
            <p>Veteran pilots like to say that a good landing is any landing everybody walks away from; and it's a <I>great</I>
                landing if the plane can be flown again. In family business terms, it is a happy ending when the whole
                family survives with their capital free to create new opportunities for all, and with appreciation for
                how thoughtfully and earnestly their business stewards created those opportunities.</P>
