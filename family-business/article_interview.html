      What code of professional ethics do you subscribe to? (Each discipline and license has a corresponding set of ethical standards. The professional should be conversant with those and happy to answer your questions about confidentiality and dual relationships.)</td></tr></table><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>3.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      Are you already bound to confidentiality, with respect to this conversation? (The answer will certainly be yes, but make it explicit.)</td></tr></table><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>4.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      Is there anyone you work with, who might come under the umbrella of your confidential relationship with us? (You are simply establishing that the professional takes responsibility for his or her notes, files, and discussions with professional colleagues. He or she guarantees privacy in every way.) </td></tr></table><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>5.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      Who would your client be? Is your relationship with one individual, or with our whole family or business? (If seeking help for an individual adult family member, the relationship should be with that member only. If it is a child or developmentally disabled adult, then the relationship should be with that person AND parents or guardians. If the work involves multiple members of your family or business, then it is important to establish that the family or the business is the client, and that the consultant has a procedure for maintaining appropriate individual confidentiality while building trust with all involved members.)</td></tr></table><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>6.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      Do you sell any products or receive any form of compensation other than for your time?  (<b>Absolutely not.</b>)</td></tr></table><br>

    <b>If responses to any of the foregoing are unsatisfactory, end the conversation at this time.  Otherwise go on to describe the concerns that have led you to seek a consultant in the mental health or family dynamics field. You should feel comfortable telling the consultants whatever they need to know at this point, to get an idea how they would approach the task. Finish with a few more questions of your own:</b><br><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>7.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      What is the breadth of clientele and problems you work with in your current consulting practice? What proportion of your work involves family firms? How many of your clients are high net worth families with family offices or similar wealth management entities?</td></tr></table><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>8.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      Do you have any relevant publications that would be helpful for us to read in the process of choosing our consultant?</td></tr></table><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>9.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      Can you give me some references (clients or professional advisors) who are familiar with work you&apos;ve done with families like ours?</td></tr></table><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>10.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      What are your fees? (These should be either straight per day or per hour, or based on estimated time for the specific requirements of a project; not a retainer or any kind of standard fee. Travel expenses are additional.)</td></tr></table><br>

    <h3>Questions to ask yourself after initial conversations with each candidate:</h3>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>11.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      Did they ask smart questions and show they understood what I was saying?</td></tr></table><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>12.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      Did they give examples of prior experience with issues like the ones we face?</td></tr></table><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>13.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      Did they make too many assumptions and already seem to have the answer? (Bad) Or were they prepared to learn through a process of inquiry, interviewing the appropriate individuals and facilitating discussion among us so as to work toward an understanding from which solutions might emerge?</td></tr></table><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>14.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      Did they seem committed to a particular clinical theory or school, or a favorite tool which they tend to impose on all clients? (Bad.)</td></tr></table><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>15.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      Were they comfortable talking with someone of my background, age, gender, and community? Did I feel good rapport, and would most members of my family (including those of the older or younger generation) feel good rapport with them?</td></tr></table><br>

    <table width='100%' border='0'><tr><td width='40' valign='top' align='left'>16.</td><td valign='top' align='left'>
      Did their initial recommendations about how to begin the work make sense?</td></tr></table>



    <h3>Summary</h3>

    In short, you&apos;re checking out four aspects of any psychological consultant whom your family might consider engaging. You might even want to assign each candidate a grade in each of these areas, and then hire only a person to whom you give four A&apos;s:<br><br>
