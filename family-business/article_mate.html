        <h2>Mate Selection and Family Business Success</h2><i>Kenneth Kaye, Ph.D.</i> (reprint of an invited article in
        <i>Family Business Review</i>, 1999)</h2>

        <P><i><b>Abstract. </b> An index of a family's success is the caliber of talent it manages to attract and retain
            through marriage. This fundamental fact in sociology, anthropology, and history has received little
            attention in the family business field. Parents in Western societies have two windows of opportunity to
            enhance long-term family success through marriage: first, before their children reach puberty; and later,
            after they choose spouses for themselves.</P>
        </I>

        <P><b>Case 1.</b>&#9;A son of an entrepreneurial family, who had low self esteem and only two years of college,
            married someone he had known since their childhood religious camp. They cared for and respected each other;
            it seemed a marriage likely to last. His parents, whose litmus test was religious denomination, were
            pleased. </P>
        <P><b>Case 2.</b>&#9;A daughter of an extremely dominant entrepreneur found a husband who did her thinking for
            her, as her father had. He accepted a job with the family business, and immediately became inordinately
            interested in salary, perquisites, and what he called &quot;our&quot; expected inheritance. Her parents were
            disappointed, wondering why their daughter had made such a poor choice and saddled their business with an
            ungrateful dependent. </P>
        <P><b>Case 3.</b>&#9;A son married a woman whose master's degree in accounting outshone the educational level of
            everyone in his family. Far from being threatened by her, they were delighted. </P>
        <P><b>Case 4.</b>&#9;A daughter with no interest in her family business went to graduate school in an esoteric
            field, which her parents considered a dead end. She married and moved with her husband to the opposite end
            of the country, where their academic jobs eventually brought them a secure though limited income, great
            benefits including subsidized private education for their children, and long vacations. Her father kept
            hinting that his son-in-law could &quot;make real money&quot; whenever they were ready to move back to
            Indiana.</P>

        <P>This article discusses a frequent, long-standing source of conflict between the generations in wealthy
            families. In fact, it arises in most middle-class families as well, whether or not they own a business; and
            it is a universal theme in world literature: Who is a suitable mate for one's child? And who gets to decide
            that? If it's a society where parents arrange marriages, how can they prevent rebellion like that of
            Shakespeare's Juliet? In a world where parents are barely consulted, how can they influence their children's
            matrimonial choices, and how can children marry for <I>both</I> love and their parents' approval? </P>
        <P>My thesis is that the two generations share a goal, which is rarely made explicit, to build the family's
            human and intellectual capital. There are consistent mistakes that lead families into conflict over mate
            selection; but on the other hand, consistent principles characterize families like number (3), in which both
            generations feel successful. I think we can define family success in mate selection; and I shall propose
            that even in our individualistic, anti-authoritarian society, parents have considerable influence upon
            it.</P>
        <h3>Preserving or dissipating wealth</h3>
        <P>In a recent speech to stewards of large family fortunes, the CEO of a 5th-generation firm with more than 40
            shareholders and beneficiaries referred to &quot;The Four Evils.&quot; Enemies of all who would pass wealth
            to descendants, he said, are Inflation, Taxation, Consumption, and Overprocreation. (He assumed that
            preserving family wealth is desirable.) His audience well knew how those four inexorable factors
            mathematically erode and dissipate financial capital.</P>
        <P>Those four &quot;evils&quot; are only part of the story, as financial capital is only part of it. With the
            best financial planning in the world, a family's <I>human</I> and <I>intellectual</I> capital can wither,
            frustrating its progenitors' dreams. And by that I mean all the progenitors. Individuals who inherit
            financial wealth typically trace it back to the success of one couple, encouraging the conceit that the
            family's identity and heritage derive only from those &quot;founders&quot;. Hence the genealogical inverted
            tree structure. But intellectual and human capital flow from all four grandparents, all eight
            great-grandparents, etc. For someone to fancy herself &quot;a Rockefeller&quot; (for example) gives undue
            status to a small fraction of her ancestry&mdash;based on money, not necessarily brains or character. </P>
        <P>Of course, the &quot;founders&quot; who started with little or no financial capital were using their human
            resources to create wealth. As the U.S. has proved in the last 50 years, economic growth in a free market
            society enriches entrepreneurs far more than it does the already wealthy. That fact alone speaks to the
            significance of human and intellectual capital.</P>
        <P>The rich get richer, for about one generation. After that, it is the smart, the hard-working, and the
            dedicated who get richer at the expense of families who are complacent. Therefore, although parents
            throughout history have worried about who enters the family through marriage, it is especially significant
            in a class-permeable society. Mate selection is a fifth &quot;evil&quot; for financially successful families
            to worry about&mdash;but it can also present opportunity for securing a family's advantages. </P>
        <h3>Family business success equals increase in children's advantage </h3>
        <P>Entrepreneurs and investors often measure success and failure in terms of net worth: How much have we
            increased it? Are we continuing to move up the scale from &quot;shirtsleeves&quot; to tailored suits, from
            rice paddy to palace (Hughes, 1997), or are we regressing back to the middle class&mdash;or worse? (As the
            CEO speaker suggested, fecundity puts enormous pressures on wealth-building requirements just to stay level,
            let alone move up the scale.)</P>
        <P>A measure of parents' success is the extent to which they create opportunities for their children, enabling
            the next generation to start their adult lives with an advantage over other young adults in the same
            society. More precisely, the measure of how well parents have done is how much they have <I>increased</I>
            their children's competitive advantages, relative to wherever they themselves started two or three decades
            earlier. </P>
        <P>Successful parents may provide opportunities in the form of a healthy business, a professional degree,
            investment capital, a strong network of personal connections, or what the child carries inside: mental
            health, sound principles, and positive self-esteem. Most of us try to give our children as many of those
            competitive advantages as we can (and parents in many cultures actively arrange or restrict marriages in
            hopes of securing family advancement or at least preventing a backslide down the slippery socioeconomic
            slope). We do that because the drive to create advantages for offspring is a biological instinct. </P>
        <P>Quantitatively, parental success can be defined as the <I>value added to next-generation opportunity</I>.
            Such a definition would embrace those who don't enter the business as well as those who do. It refers to the
            average opportunity per child across the whole family; both genders; brilliant children as well as dull
            ones, regardless of their proclivities and gifts. </P>
        <P>Family success has nothing to do with retaining ownership of a business. In fact, entrepreneurially created
            opportunities take many different forms, most of which are better accessed with cash (for postgraduate
            tuition, travel, investment, politics, philanthropy, financial independence, etc.) than with the inside
            track to a job in a parent's company.</P>
        <P>The value added to all siblings' head starts in life by their parents' enterprise is a nice theoretical
            quantification of success, but hard to measure in practice. Mate selection, though only a component of the
            value-adding or -detracting process, has for centuries served as a rough practical index of family success.
            Probably this is because people have seen that the ability to help children &quot;marry well&quot;
            distinguishes families who continue to create opportunities from those who ultimately don't. </P>
        <h3>Open systems</h3>
        <P>The connection between family business success and marriage is an essential feature of family systems
            theory.</P>
        <P>The laws of thermodynamics hold&mdash;and they hold quite well&mdash;that all systems, from atoms to stars,
            eventually lose energy and disintegrate. (This is called <I>entropy</I>). Plants and animals die, decay, and
            their amino acid molecules break down into elemental atoms. Even inorganic structures like mountains and
            pyramids eventually crumble. The works of man and the works of nature, while they live, don't disprove the
            laws of thermodynamics but they do manage to postpone that inevitable dissipation, sometimes for a very long
            time. Groves of aspen in the Rocky Mountains are single organisms (each &quot;tree&quot; is only a shoot),
            which are believed to be as old as 10,000 years. Coral reefs are adaptive structures that defy the erosive
            action of waves for hundreds of thousands of years. </P>
        <I><P>Entropy</I> is the inevitable breakdown of structure. Nothing defeats entropy, but living systems are
        remarkably good at resisting it for periods of time ranging from minutes to aeons. Because they maintain their
        structure, complexity, and energy by interacting with their environments, organisms, families, and organizations
        are called <I>open</I> systems. The earth's atmosphere has been in equilibrium, resisting entropy and
        maintaining a 21 per cent oxygen content for the benefit of life as we know it, for more than three billion of
        the planet's four and a half billion years (Lovelock, 1979). Gaia has achieved that world record by exchanging
        elements through chemical reactions with the sea, with terrestrial organisms, rocks, and outer space.</P>
        <P>Some ecosystems have life spans of millions of years. Individual organisms have life spans ranging from
            thousands of years to only a few minutes, yet all are achieved by self-regulatory exchange processes that
            are equally remarkable in defying entropy. All open systems use self-regulatory processes to speed up or
            slow down, grow larger or downsize, increase or decrease their materials purchasing, stockpile or use up
            inventories, eliminate more or less waste, ship more or less of their products, all in the service of
            maintaining the necessary equilibrium for long-term survival of their genes (Dawkins, 1989). If the open
            system we are talking about is a closely held business, it does those things for long-term survival of the
            family's identity, values, heritage&mdash;the social equivalent of its genes&mdash;as well as for the
            owners' actual genes.</P>
        <P>Consider the defining characteristics of open systems:</P>


        <P>
            &#9;they import energy (find and exploit external resources)
        <P>
            &#9;they eliminate waste products</P>
        <P>
            &#9;they create information (organization, as opposed to randomness) </P>
        <P>
            &#9;they perpetuate themselves</P>
        <P>
            &#9;if they can, they grow; but if growth endangers their perpetuation, they &quot;downsize&quot;</P>
        <P>
            &#9;if they become <I>closed</I> systems (shut off from external resources or from ways of shedding material
            they cannot use), they die</P>


        <P>In short, the key to all open systems is <I>finding, exploiting, and organizing <B>external</B> resources</I>.
            That is why a system like a family-owned business, one of whose goals is to increase the opportunity
            advantages of its owners' children, must reach out beyond its boundaries for educational and technological
            resources to put at the service of the family members. For example, their business must employ the most
            talented non-family members they can recruit. Otherwise, it is a closed&mdash;doomed&mdash;system. </P>
        <h3><P>Exogamous tribes</h3>
        <P>That point about non-family executives has often been said before. But there are <I>two</I> ways a family
            manages to attract outside talent: (a) through the recruitment of non-family executives to run its
            enterprises, and (b) through marriage. If (a) and (b) are accomplished together, either because someone
            enters the family through marriage who turns out to be a valuable business recruit or because a great
            executive turns up in the business and later marries into the family, so much the better. But essentially
            there are two kinds of search, executive and marital. The latter consumes enormous personal attention, for
            good reason&mdash;and it deserves more of our professional attention as well.</P>
        <P>In marriage choices as in executive recruitment, success requires what anthropologists call <I>exogamy</I>
            (Greek roots meaning <I>out-marrying</I>): reaching beyond the tribe for new genetic, cultural, or
            technological resources. In business terms, <I>exogamy</I> simply means filling a position through an
            outside search, acquiring intellectual, social, and managerial assets for the family through marriage&mdash;not
            settling for the boy or girl next door. The marriages children make can produce enormous gains for a
            business family, not only in financial capital but emotional and intellectual capital: in education,
            experience, and technological resources. Or they can drag the family backward. They can be a means of
            recruiting great business managers into a family, or a harbinger of business suicide. But they are important
            even when neither spouse works in the business, because every marriage choice has profound implications for
            the gene pool and for the psychological health of the following generation. </P>
        <P>Of course, openness to new kinds of people isn't the first instinct of a parent <I>or</I> of a business
            owner. Their first instinct is to look within their own social group. Openness is risky. Just as recruiting
            talented managers, or a CEO, or board members requires a thoughtful balance between the need for &quot;new
            blood&quot; and the importance of a good fit with elements of the corporate culture that are working well,
            similarly the search for a mate involves balancing novelty with comfort. Spouses should share a language,
            fundamental values, and a set of expectations about roles and mutual reliance. But they also need to
            surprise, delight, and challenge each other. </P>
        <P>For parents, there is an issue of trust every time children marry outside the tribe. We trust others in
            proportion to how well we think we know them. When a potential son- or daughter-in-law's background is very
            different from one's own, trust may take a little longer to establish. It is human to be more comfortable,
            initially, with someone who has all the right credentials on paper: plays golf or tennis, belongs to the
            right church or synagogue, attended the right schools, and has the right season tickets. However, such trust
            can be misplaced. Someone with the right credentials can turn out to be a wastrel or a scoundrel, or simply
            an airhead. </P>
        <h3>Should matchmaking be a new family business consulting specialty?</h3>
        <P>When I work with a family whose younger generation has already married, I often feel that those decisions and
            actions already taken will have greater effect on their fortunes than anything I can help them with. How the
            next generation of parents raise their children is more significant for their long-term chances of
            preserving family wealth than what they do in their business. </P>
        <P>With young adults who are still single, the <I>kind</I> of people they are likely to marry was probably
            determined years ago. Their range of marriage opportunities, as well as the choices they will make within
            that range, were shaped in childhood and adolescence. </P>
        <P>Although I don't plan to add a matchmaking page to my website, I do sometimes offer a word of counsel on this
            subject to the older or younger generations:</P>
        <B><I><U>
            <P>Advice to parents:</P>
        </B></I></U><P>The lesson from happy families&mdash;and it is consistent with everything we know about
        developmental psychology&mdash;is that our only chance to influence their choice of mate successfully is by
        preparing children early to make good choices when the time comes. Recognizing that our children are going to
        choose for themselves (for better or worse), we need to begin doing the things listed in Table 1 when our
        children are young. If the list falls into three pairs of do's and don'ts, it is because the parental art is a
        balancing act. </P>
        <P>Your own marriage is the best model your children will have as they envision what it would be like to marry a
            particular individual. No marriage is perfect, so be sure they know what the strengths of your marriage are,
            or were. (They probably have a fine sense of its weak points.)</P>

        </I><P>Unfortunately, most parents wait until their son or daughter has fallen in love with someone, and then
        they either breathe a sigh of relief or try to pose objections: She is not Jewish, or he is not Catholic, or not
        Italian, or not from &quot;a good family.&quot; That is a sure formula for family conflict. If they break up,
        your child may blame you. If they marry anyway, your new in-law comes into the family as an opponent. Therefore,
        by early adulthood or even adolescence, the more directly you attempt to influence a child's marriage choices,
        the more spectacularly you will fail. The best practice is to accept the fact that there is no way to interfere
        with a child's poor marriage choice without making the situation worse. </P>
        <P>After <I>accepting</I> a new family member, there are many things you can do to bring out the best in that
            person. The chief point, indicated throughout Table 2, is to concentrate on strengths. How can family
            resources be used to enhance the gifts he or she brings, from experience as well as from nature? What can
            you do to support the young couple's sense of full responsibility for the family's future? And if you do
            have serious reservations about the individual&mdash;for example, stupidity, laziness, addiction, or
            irresponsibility&mdash;all you can do is avoid feeding the problem: don't protect the in-law from
            accountability. But any active judgmental position is unlikely to help and very likely to undermine your own
            goals.</P>

        </I><P>You <I>don't</I> have to employ him or her. The temptation and external pressure to do so may be greater,
        the less productively employable the individual is; but the long-term consequences of yielding to that
        temptation warrant careful thought, case by case.</P>
        <P>Finally, prenuptial agreements are infinitely less effective than having trained your child to choose a mate
            wisely. At best, a prenuptial contract protects financial capital. It takes great sensitivity to do the
            latter without damaging the human capital.</P>

        <B><I><U><P>Advice to young people:</P>
        </B></I></U><P>Before committing yourself to marriage&mdash;if you intend to produce children&mdash;ask whether
        this is the person you would want raising them if you were to die before they were grown.</P>
        <P>Don't marry anyone to spite your parents, or just because he or she contrasts with them. With all their
            faults, don't your parents possess some qualities that you would need in a spouse?</P>
        <P>Most importantly, understand the valid reasons for their concern about who you bring into the family. Even if
            you discount their opinions about your happiness and well-being, consider their thinking about the three
            kinds of family wealth. Their criteria may be crazy, and their methods repulsive, and their timing ten or
            twenty years too late&mdash;but they are correct in thinking that this decision has enormous ramifications
            for the continued building (or rapid squandering) of everything they have worked for.</P>
        <B><I><U>
            <P>Advice to consultants:</P>
        </B></I></U><P>The examples in the opening section of this article come from the author's own practice. The
        first young man married down, in that his wife didn't seem to have the intelligence (of any kind) to hold her
        own with his family. She lacked sophistication, ambition, and talent. Fortunately, his parents were so pleased
        with the young couple's religious fealty that they failed to realize their good daughter-in-law represented a
        potentially significant hindrance to their family's continued upward mobility. (No, I didn't tell them. I do
        recognize that my definition of long-term family success-enhancement of opportunity&mdash;ignored such
        trivialities as love and happiness. <I>All four</I> of the couples in my examples married for love, and are
        happy together.)</P>
        <P>In example (2), the parents wondered why their daughter saddled both herself and their business with an
            ungrateful dependent. They didn't see that both of those problems were of their own making. They should have
            given her more respect for herself, of course; but even after she married the mooch, they didn't have to
            give him a job for which he was unqualified and a salary he didn't earn. It <I>is</I> a consultant's job to
            raise that issue.</P>
        <P>The third example was one of improving the family through marriage. The young man's parents described their
            accountant daughter-in-law as a &quot;prize&quot;, regardless whether she worked in the business or (as
            happened) chose to stay at home while her children were young.</P>
        <P>In example (4), neither the daughter nor her husband worked in the business. Nonetheless her exogamous
            marriage is an index of the family business's success. Why? Because it was the income from that business
            that gave her the opportunity to pursue a satisfying career, and marry someone with his own satisfying
            career. Philosophy had not been a vocational option for either of her parents. Furthermore, when, in a
            couple of decades, the daughter's children become beneficiaries of the generation-skipping trusts her
            parents created, they are likely to be well equipped both intellectually and emotionally to manage that
            substantial wealth sensibly.</P>
        <P>If, as outside consultants, we share this perspective about the importance of children's education,
            self-esteem, values, and attracting new blood, should we and can we sell that perspective to our clients? I
            think we can, somewhat, sometimes.</P>
        <P>In the United States, our present-day culture increases the challenge for advisors. Parents play such limited
            roles in mate selection; why even bring the subject up? We don't live in a world of arranged marriages.
            However, parents do inculcate snobbery and prejudices in their children, and discourage contact with people
            whom they assume to be inferiors. A sociobiologist might say that such prejudices serve the same function in
            narrowing a child's search criteria as they would in an arranged marriage culture. </P>
        <P>The notion of &quot;marrying up&quot; or &quot;marrying down&quot; may sound like something out of a
            nineteenth-century novel: worrying about what society will say. But that is absolutely not what I mean. Our
            definition of family success refers to actual competitive advantage, <I>avoiding</I> the prejudicial errors
            of one's community. Parents' initial assessment of the candidate's human capital is often based on the wrong
            criteria: inadequate litmus tests such as race, religion, and class. Nor am I referring to the prospective
            mate's family's money. Of course, a family may acquire financial capital through marriage; but that is
            rarely as significant as what it acquires or fails to acquire in human capital. </P>
        <P>Perhaps our most constructive role is to challenge members of both generations to think about the actual
            qualities of individuals who may be candidates to join the family, wherever they come from. And we can push
            parents to see how their long-term goals for their families depend upon the quality of relationships they
            build with sons- and daughters-in-law. </P>
        <P>Among business-owning families, we encounter all four types of &quot;in-law&quot; situations exemplified
            above: those that enhance the family in some way (3 and 4) and those that don't (1 and 2); and in either
            case, parents who realize the fact (2 and 3) and those who don't (1 and 4). Would it be useful for a
            consultant to advise an entrepreneur whose business seems to be declining and whose sons and daughters are
            models of mediocrity, &quot;Try to get your kids to marry people more capable and self-confident than
            themselves?&quot; Obviously not&mdash;it would be too late. The time for them to receive the advice in Table
            1 would have been many years before they engaged us as advisors. </P>
        <P>Nor would we say to the client described in example (1), above, &quot;You're foolish to feel so complacent
            about your son's marriage. Your daughter-in-law may be easy for you to relate to because she shares so many
            of your convictions, but she brings nothing to your family other than below-average I.Q., a lack of
            imagination, spinelessness (which you like, as she doesn't challenge you) and dull-witted grandchildren.&quot; </P>
        <P>On the other hand, what about the daughter and son-in-law described in example (4)? Her parents appreciated
            my pointing out that their business success had allowed her to enjoy an academic life without worrying about
            accumulating wealth. </P>
        <P>Finally, in example (2), the parents are justifiably concerned about the impact of their son-in-law on both
            the business and the family. They may need the consultant's help in building appropriate safeguards into the
            governance structure and succession processes; as well as assertiveness about such touchy matters as
            prenuptial agreements and restrictive trusts.</P>
        <h3>A needed dissertation</h3>
        <P>What we are discussing is no less than a theory about mate selection and successful families. It raises the
            possibility of observing one of the ways a family business system succeeds or fails to use external
            resources for its own advantage. If we're right in calling our client families &quot;systems&quot;, we
            should be able to make some long-term predictions about their viability. Of course, we won't confuse family
            success with keeping the business in the family (Kaye, 1996). </P>
        <P>I would suggest that anyone who hopes to assess the strength of a family enterprise, or of any fortunate
            family, might derive an index of success more parsimoniously from the quality of people who marry members of
            that family than from any complex and elusive set of measures on the members themselves.</P>
        <P>How could this theory be tested? Find 50 families whose fortunes over a couple of generations clearly moved
            in the positive direction. Compare them with 50 families whose fortunes declined relative to the society as
            a whole. If I am right in postulating mate selection as an index of the families' success, then the average
            educational level and/or occupational index of spouses who married into those families during the two
            previous generations will differ significantly between the upwardly and downwardly mobile samples. </P>
        <P>Hughes (1997) advocates measuring a family's human and intellectual capital, and tracking it over time. I'm
            saying that such an assessment would need to include the family members who enter by attachment, not only by
            birth; and in fact the relative talents of those people alone might prove a good index of the whole family's
            success.</P>
        <P>Supposing that some data could be found to test this hypothesis, and that the results supported the theory,
            processes of cause and effect would still remain to be studied. My theory is that the long-term progress of
            family fortunes (opportunity advantages for descendants, relative to their cohorts) is the outcome of
            behavior listed in Table 1. The importance of self esteem in child development suggests that those
            recommendations are the best way to help one's children attract the most promising family wealth
            enhancers. </P>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <P>Research in evolutionary biology confirms Darwin's observation that diversity is a key to adaptation (Weiner,
            1994). It follows that too little diversity and too much mediocrity in marriage partners pose long-term
            threats to family systems' competitive advantages. </P>
        <P>We do our clients a disservice if we facilitate their succession and estate planning, focusing on the problem
            of preserving their financial capital, without equal or greater emphasis on their human and intellectual
            capital. As Jay Hughes puts it,</P>


        <P>Financial capital alone cannot provide long-term wealth preservation. What a family's financial capital can
            provide is a powerful tool to promote the growth of its human and intellectual capital. After all, without
            human capital there are no family assets; there is no family! Without intellectual capital, under-educated
            family members with all the money in the world will not make enough good decisions over a long period of
            time to outnumber their bad decisions. Successful long-term wealth preservation lies in understanding that
            it is the growth of a family's human and intellectual capital that determines its success, and that the
            growth of its financial capital provides a powerful tool to achieve this success. (Hughes, 1997, pp.
            21-22)</P>


        <P>Of the ways parents can influence all three kinds of capital, their ability to influence children's mate
            selection is among the least direct ways. It happens, at best, through indirect influence (role modeling,
            inculcating values, self-esteem) and only over the whole course of childhood, adolescence, and early
            adulthood. Yet the effect of those marriage choices on subsequent generations' opportunities is greater than
            any of those factors a parent can influence more directly. It may be as great as all the direct factors
            combined.</P>
        <P>As for parents whose children have chosen unwisely, the best advice is to ask not what you can do to weaken
            the relationship, but whether a more strategic and judicious use of family resources can leverage that
            individual's strengths while avoiding the perpetuation of problems.</P>
