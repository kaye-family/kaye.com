        <h2>Roles
            of Trust in Consulting to Financial Families</h2>
        <i>Kenneth Kaye, Sara Hamilton</i>

        <p><i>Trust is not only crucial to success among the owners of
            substantial wealth, it is also the </i>sine qua non<i> for successful teamwork
            among professionals who work with them. There can be dangers, however, in too much trust and too little
            healthy
            confrontation, just as there are in mistrust and chronic conflict. </i><i><span
                style='font-size:14. 0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10. 0pt'></span></i></p>


        <p>A consulting assignment becomes more complex as there are
            more family branches; as those branches are tied together in more business
            relationships; as more corporations, partnerships, and trusts own their assets;
            as they do business in more states and foreign countries; as they have more
            advisors involved; and as more transition events approach (a leader retiring, a
            matriarch passing away, a trust terminating, a business being sold, etc. ). <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Complicating factors can also include
            publicly traded stock, a family's prominence, a tragedy or a scandal, and of
            course, the whole gamut of addictions and other mental health issues. </p>

        <p>Although much of this article will apply to all family
            business consulting, financial families are defined as those that are complex
            in all or most of the ways mentioned above. </p>

        <p>The authors are, respectively, a psychologist specializing in
            conflict resolution and successor development in family firms of all sizes, and
            the founder/CEO of Family Office Exchange, an organization that assists owners
            of substantial wealth with multi-generational family office and wealth
            management. Co-consulting to such cases
            has sharpened our focus on some problems about trust. Here we refer not to the legal entity, <i>a</i>
            <i>trust </i>(a
            property interest held by one person for the benefit of another), but to the
            vital aspect of all human relationships, <i>trust </i>(reliance on another's
            character, ability, strength, or truthfulness). </p>

        <p>Family Office Exchange, Inc. , has collected data on more than
            2000 families owning between $100 million and several billion in assets. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Financial families highlight the roles of
            trust, especially with regard to three constant challenges of consulting work:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Constant Challenge #1: devote careful attention to the
                working alliance between consultant(s) and clients;
            </li>

            <li>Constant Challenge #2: always build processes that will
                accommodate change, rather than permanent structures the clients will have to
                live within;
            </li>

            <li>Constant Challenge #3: bring together a
                multidisciplinary consulting team, and manage relationships among its members
                as well as the family's long-term advisors and key employees. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Different disciplines will be required in different cases, but they will normally 
		include at least one 'content' person
        who concentrates on the legal entities, forms of governance or management, and
        knowledge of applicable best practices for the given type of business; while at
        least one 'process person' is primarily tuned to the interactions, human
        development, and unconscious group dynamics. Both types must have some training in, and be alert to the other's
        perspective. </p>


        <p>Those three challenging aspects of consultation are today
            widely accepted in the literature and practice (Swartz, 1989; Hilburt-Davis
            &amp; Senturia, 1995; Bork, Jaffe, Lane, Dashew, &amp; Heisler, 1995; Davidow
            &amp; Narva, 2001). This article
            discusses them in connection with trust among family members, among outsiders,
            and between the two groups. </p>

        <p>There is a growing literature on the role of trust within
            business families (Powell, 1987; Bradach &amp; Eccles, 1989; Kaye, 1995;
            LaChapelle &amp; Barnes, 1998; Lansberg, 1999; Steier, 2001; Hamilton &amp;
            Kaye, 2003). There is also literature
            on trust in the process of advising them (Alderfer, 1988; Whiteside &amp;
            Brown, 1991; Kaye, 1994). We argue that
            managing trust is the <i>sine qua non</i> when working with all sizes of family
            firms. </p><br><br>

        <h2 style='text-align:justify'>The Trust Catalyst</h2>

        <p>A central concept throughout this discussion is that of the
            Trust Catalyst. LaChapelle &amp; Barnes
            (1998) pointed out that amid the frustrations, anxieties, and disharmony that
            can hamper the work of a business family, often one person helps create higher
            trust. The same person maintains that
            role for years, even decades. It could
            be the wife and mother of an owner and his children. It could be a high-status friend of the parents,
            respected
            by the
            younger generation without the ambivalence of a parent/child relationship. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(In <i>The Sopranos</i>, Hesh Rabkin, old
            friend of Tony Soprano's father, is the guy everyone wants at the table if they
            have to arrange a 'sit-down'. )<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>A Trust
            Catalyst may be an uncle, an in-law, an attorney or other long-term advisor. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In multi-branch families, it can be one of
            the CEO's siblings or cousins, or even a member of the successor
            generation. In many businesses, a
            non-family president, CFO, or head of Human Resources provides a bridge of
            trust between the generations. </p>

        <p>LaChapelle and Barnes used the word <i>catalyst </i>because
            these members inspire other family members and business partners to trust each
            other. Family members basically want to
            do so, but past experiences have put them on guard. Trust Catalysts serve as reminders of the family
            'glue'. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They seem to put a damper on conflict, often
            by little more than being good listeners and remaining calm. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>LaChapelle and Barnes give examples of
            successful transitions aided by the presence of a Trust Catalyst in the family
            business. They contrast those with some
            examples of chronic conflicts when no one fills that role. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

        <p>Clearly, in interviewing a family and its key employees,
            consultants should look for the existence of one or more Trust Catalysts. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, one should not assume that their
            effect is always salutary. We will
            revisit the concept of the Trust Catalyst as we explore each of the three
            constant challenges in family consultations. </p><br><br>

        <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Constant Challenge #1: Awareness of the Alliance</h2>

        <p><a name="OLE_LINK1">The greatest determiner of successful
            change in a family business is the consultants' ability to maintain a working
            alliance with leaders in the client system-and to keep moving the engagement
            forward step by step (Vago, 2003). </a>Clinical
            psychologists call it the 'therapeutic alliance. 'This is a more consistent factor in success than the
            consultants'
            stores of knowledge (management, law, family systems theory, best practices in
            human resources or in wealth management or in family office
            administration). The alliance affects
            the success of a consultation more than how 'dysfunctional' the system appears
            to be, how profitable the business is, or the size of the assets at stake. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First and foremost, we have to engage with
            the family business system-in fact, become temporarily part of it-so we
            ourselves can exercise leadership within it. To put this another way, if the family doesn't have a Trust
            Catalyst
            already, we need to perform that role, for awhile; and if they do, we need to
            be another one. </p>

        <p>When clients make progress by achieving a stated
            objective-for example, adopt a mission statement or a set of by-laws, resolve a
            family member's desire to take his equity out of the business, agree on new
            roles, hire a new CEO, or establish a family office-the consultant keeps the
            engine running and ready to depart as soon as the passengers are ready for the
            next stage of their journey. But even
            when the process stalls, or regresses a step or two, the alliance enables
            consultants to reassure the clients, alleviate anxieties, resolve conflicts,
            and get the train back on the track. </p>

        <p>If the consultants are wise and skillful and their styles and
            values are compatible with those of the client family, then the clients will
            have made a valuable investment in the consultants' learning about the family
            members, their business challenges, and their long-term needs. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The consultants have developed rapport and
            learned how to communicate differently with individual family members. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The clients may have asked for help with a single
            event, but this was a step in a long process with which they'll need help, from
            various professionals, over the years. Frankly, they need to be shown what they're really in the midst
            of. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They usually don't know what questions to
            ask. They know what hurts, but not why. They don't know which problems
            will lessen with time, and which will get worse if untreated. If this makes consulting sound like a sales
            job, so it is. (The first author prefers to see himself as Yoda in <i>Star Wars</i>. )</p>

        <p>Conversely, if consultants lose an engagement because the
            clients blame them for a painful experience that didn't achieve its objective, <i>or
            </i>it achieves an objective without raising awareness about the big picture,
            then not only have the consultants lost future business, but the clients have
            wasted the time and money they invested in the consultants' learning about
            them. </p>

        <p>Family business consultants reveal how important the personal
            alliance is when we present a case to colleagues at a conference or
            workshop. We invariably tell the story
            as a sequence of interpersonal moments. If we're presenting a fairly successful consultation, we may describe
            a
            'stuck' phase where their resistance to change had us temporarily stymied, and
            then we'll say, 'That is when cousin Bob called me' (indicating a key person on
            the genogram). </p>

        <p>In those same presentations, we consultants often explain our
            failures by pointing to key members on the chart with whom we were unable to
            form a constructive personal relationship. For example, one of the authors was two years into an engagement
            with
            a
            family. This family suffered from a
            long-standing rift between the CEO (who was also the sole active trustee of a
            dynasty trust) and his wife, on one side, versus the rest of the family. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When the wife made a hurtful remark about
            another family member in our meeting, the author's attempt at neutral
            intervention alienated her. A few
            months later he resigned, since he had lost the trust of a powerful, besieged
            branch of the family. He had been
            unable to make the case for better tolerance because of his own failure to
            establish a good enough alliance with both sides. </p>

        <p>That failure was particularly instructive because the client
            system did have a Trust Catalyst. The
            family office's outside attorney was an expert on their problematic content
            area-the trusts and holding companies they inherited-but was also sensitive to
            the emotional upheaval into which their father's death had thrust them. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This Trust Catalyst, in fact, was the one
            who had brought the author in as family process consultant. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But a good alliance between the embedded
            Trust Catalyst and the outside consultant wasn't enough. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The author had failed to become, himself, a
            Trust Catalyst for the family. </p>

        <p>Such experiences taught us that our consulting team has to
            become a temporary member of what Davis (1983) called the 'sentient system. '</p>

        <p><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>'A subsystem [of the whole family business] is the sentient system
            that has the family at its core and is made of individuals bound by strong
            emotional and loyalty bonds. The
            sentient system will generally include nonfamily members who are 'drawn into'
            and become subject to the basic organizing rules of the family' (p.  51). </p><br><br>

        <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Constant Challenge #2: Always build
            processes--and trust is one of them</h2>

        <p>Creating a process that can accommodate change is much more
            important than any structure the founder and advisors might devise. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each generation must be prepared for
            responsibilities their parents can't foresee. The ship is moving. That is why
            the estate plan should be understood to be as much process as structure. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The process must accommodate the development
            of leadership in the next generation, just as it must accommodate the
            beneficiaries' changing needs and circumstances. In each generation, the trustees and governing council of a
            family face a new set of challenges for succession to the next generation. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Will the family be able to work together on
            how to reallocate assets after the sale of a business? <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How will they handle the evolving
            administration of a family office, foundation, or trusts? <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition to the functions of those who serve
            on the Board, processes for the whole family include continually improving
            communications, resolving conflicts, reaffirming purpose, developing human
            capital, and perhaps most important of all, continually reassessing how well
            the trustees and advisors are fulfilling their roles (Hughes, 1997). <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

        <p>Does the importance of processes mean the 'process'
            consultant is the team's leader? No. In fact, he or she may
            observe from the sidelines much of the time while the 'content' consultants
            educate and stimulate the group. The
            content expert will be equally concerned that what the clients are building is
            a set of processes to accommodate change. </p>

        <p>We try to teach our clients, when they have problems of
            mistrust (as all people do), that trust is not black and white. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It, too, is a process (Barnes, 1981;
            Lansberg, 1999; Hamilton &amp; Kaye, 2003). The decision to entrust responsibility to someone is not a binary
            decision, to do so or not. The question
            <i>in whom</i> to place trust is inseparable from <i>how much</i> trust to place,
            and <i>in what areas</i> of responsibility.  </p>

        <p>In talking with clients, we have found it sufficient to
            distinguish among three types of trust: ability, honesty, and motives. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Is the person competent in this role? <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Does she tell the truth? <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Does he work for the whole family's benefit,
            not merely his own? If one of those
            kinds of trust is lost, but at least one of the others exists (for example,
            John doubts Jane's competence but trusts her motives), it may be possible to rebuild
            the needed trust (Kaye, 1995). Unfortunately,
            as we all know from our own lives, the destruction of trust can be swift and
            terrible; its reconstruction slow and exhausting. </p>

        <p>The way to build trust is to test it first by entrusting the
            person with small matters, then bigger ones as he or she proves to have been
            reliable. The responsibilities of
            ownership are entrusted in that same way, building from smaller ones (does her
            public behavior do credit to our name? ) to the privilege of participating in meetings,
            then having a vote, then chairing committees, and so forth. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

        <p>Two paradigmatic forms of economic organization are
            'hierarchy' and 'market', but there is a literature on other, hybrid forms all
            along the continuum between them (Powell, 1987; Bradach &amp; Eccles,
            1989). Trust determines where an
            organization fits on that continuum. Steier points out that as a firm evolves through the generations, 'in
            some cases, what was once a very resilient trust is replaced by an atmosphere
            of fragile trust or even distrust and an important source of strategic
            advantage is lost' (p.  353). To some
            extent, this is inevitable in the most harmonious family. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The business needs more controls as it grows
            beyond the day-to-day scope of its family owners. <i>Any</i> group of owners will need to reinvest in trust
            and
            trust-building
            activities, over time. </p><br><br>

        <h2 style='text-align:justify'>When too little trust leads to too much trust</h2>

        <p>Too little trust can quickly become a vicious circle. <span
                style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>People who mistrust others are very likely
            to become less trustworthy themselves, as they defensively withhold information
            and renege on promises. A whole culture
            of distrust is born, taking hold like cancer, making succession impossible. </p>

        <p>On the other hand, a family business can suffer from <i>too
            much trust</i>, as easily as too little. It happens when the sheer amount of learning and work required to
            exercise responsibilities of ownership tempt members to delegate some tasks
            that must not be delegated. They don't
            want to squander their wealth, but they expect it to make their lives easier,
            not harder. </p>

        <p>Owners should never delegate goal-setting, oversight,
            measuring success and holding the leaders accountable. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor should owners let anyone else decide how
            much and how long the assets will be held collectively for the benefit of
            future generations, or how involved family members will be in managing the
            wealth process. Yet they do. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ironically, in our experience with financial
            families, after a founder places <i>too little</i> trust in the next
            generation, they tend to place <i>too much</i> trust in one leader, or in
            outsiders. </p>

        <p>Consider the psychological differences between entrepreneur
            and successors. Staying in control has
            paid off well for the former. As
            risk-takers with capital, entrepreneurs trust their own instincts but not those
            of others. They often guard control and
            have difficulty trusting even their best employees, let alone their
            children. And perhaps because they know
            so well the narrow margin between success and defeat, they distrust their
            children's ability to make successes of themselves. Many don't seem to want them to succeed (McCollom,
            1992). <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore they tend to favor complex
            structures, which their children don't understand and don't want to
            manage. </p>

        <p>What happens when the wealth passes from the founder to the
            second generation? Most sibling groups
            are more risk averse than their parents were, having been taught to avoid risk
            and preserve the assets they were so fortunate to inherit. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They are more concerned about not losing it
            than with building more for future generations. So they seek to simplify complex, highly leveraged
            assets. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And they often retain overly-concentrated
            stock positions, especially in their legacy company. But they have little or no experience with the
            financial,
            tax and
            legal issues, such as the risk/reward tradeoffs surrounding an undiversified asset. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And the financial services industry makes it
            difficult for owners to learn what they need to know about the process, as most
            firms still view client education only as a marketing tool rather than a core
            business. </p>

        <p>Nor are they prepared for governance processes. <span
                style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The inheritors' job is, in some ways, more
            difficult than the one the founder was doing. They will have to make decisions as a group. They won't have the
            autocrat's luxury of being able to ignore
            unappealing suggestions (Lansberg, 1999). Having watched a patriarch operate with sole authority for 30 to 40
            years, brothers and sisters and cousins have had no role models for collective
            ownership. </p>

        <p>The next step is almost inevitable. The structures are so complicated-extending, not infrequently, to
            dozens of partially interlocking partnerships, each with different assets and
            obligations-that the inheritors have to find sophisticated advisors, and
            delegate major aspects of financial oversight to others. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

        <p>Those outsiders, respected for their knowledge and
            appreciated for relieving anxiety, are well situated to become Trust
            Catalysts. An outsider may arrive in
            this position through actual competence, good intentions, and the well-earned
            trust of family members. However, it is
            easy for families to entrust too much to one person. The successors may delegate too much authority to a
            single
            family
            member, business officer, or outside professional. They allow him or her to wear too many hats (for example,
            attorney, trustee, and director; or CEO of a business and trustee of a
            foundation that is a major shareholder), with insufficient checks and
            balances. They may thus create an
            interest that conflicts with those of the family. </p>

        <p>In our experience, when an outsider falls into this position,
            it usually happens through good intentions and the owners' desire to hold on to
            trusted relationships. When a business
            is sold, for example, they want to retain the trusted CFO, so they entrust the
            family office to him without considering experienced candidates. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet the skills that made him a wonderful CFO
            in the entrepreneurial business may be exactly wrong for wealth managing and
            trust administering. The blind lead the
            blind into new territory. </p>

        <p>In some cases, over-trusting of an outsider occurs for a
            different reason, which we call the <i>founder's inverse bias</i>:<span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>'No one in the family can be as smart as
            Grandfather was. Let's not consider any
            of our own for such important responsibilities. '(Of course, there is another group of families who will
            <i>only</i>
            trust a family member, and a third group who never commit themselves to
            trusting anyone at all, for long. )</p>

        <p>Financial families vastly underinvest in financial education
            and in training for leadership roles that owners themselves should fill. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Family Office Exchange members spend an
            average of about $20,000 per family per year, less than one hundredth of one
            per cent of their assets!</p>

        <p>Finally, over-trusting either an outsider or a family member
            can occur as a result of conflict avoidance. They may be chosen by default.  <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>When people sense that they are in over their heads, but are not
            sure what's wrong, one normal human response is to deny the complexity, to feel
            greater certitude or false confidence, suppressing unspoken doubts and plunging
            ahead into the darkness. The family may
            avoid discussing doubts about one another's competence. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They may never have acknowledged those
            doubts, even privately, so they resolve the question quickly at the first sign
            of a possible fight. </p>

        <p>This problem of trusting by default is doubly dangerous when
            the recipient is a family member, who in many cases may not have earned any
            confidence at all in his or her abilities. An outsider probably had to prove something, but with an insider
            the
            family may arrive at a flimsy consensus, either a decision to divvy up
            responsibilities or to delegate them to the member who most wants them. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At best, he or she has established
            credibility in one area, which doesn't transfer to the responsibilities being
            conferred. Trust is granted, in other
            words, not having been earned. This
            postpones and ultimately worsens conflict. </p>

        <p>Thus the conflict-avoiding benefits of a Trust Catalyst carry
            risks, equally so whether it is an outsider or a family member. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The egregious cases, in which such people
            deliberately cheat their employers or beneficiaries, are few. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We have known occasional misappropriations
            of funds. But there is another, more
            prevalent kind of damage from relying on too few family members: The others sit
            back, so to speak, and withdraw their human capital from governance. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They're in denial about how much owners and
            beneficiaries need to know, and to control, if they hope to survive as a
            wealthy family. When only one or a few
            family members pay attention to business or wealth matters, their siblings and cousins
            often forfeit any means of reviewing them and setting their compensation. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor do they assess trustees' and advisors'
            performance. </p>

        <p>In short, a family can have too little conflict as well as
            too much. Family harmony can be a
            trap. We call this kind of consensus
            'flimsy' because it will fall apart, not having been built on a working
            foundation. What is needed is a formal
            process of continual evaluation to guard against the natural human tendency to
            avoid raising uncomfortable doubts. As
            Ronald Reagan famously advised, 'trust but verify. '</p>

        <p>Another safety mechanism is the rule that all family business
            agreements should incorporate exit strategies. We emphasize with our clients that every joint endeavor they
            enter
            into,
            whether a business corporation, investment partnership, family office, or
            private trust company, must be voluntary in the sense that no individual
            dissenting partner is trapped in the relationship. One can choose to go along with the majority, but no one
            should
            be compelled to participate either by the legal structures or by family
            pressure. Such compulsion would sooner
            or later destroy their family bonds, without which their financial partnerships
            are doomed. </p>

        <p>A disaffected member who believes his own interests conflict
            with the group's should not have to attack or sabotage their shared
            business. Again, formal procedures make
            it possible to raise such questions in normal constructive discourse rather
            than destructively, in helpless rage. </p>

        <p>Our data on Family Office Exchange financial families
            indicate that about 60% of their assets are held in trusts. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One reason so many beneficiaries of trusts
            are dissatisfied is the 'arranged marriage' nature of the structure. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rare is the estate planner who cautions
            grantors that creating a trust will make its beneficiaries permanent bedfellows
            (McCollom, 1992). </p>

        <p>During a consulting engagement, the presence of the
            multidisciplinary team reduces the risk of premature agreement. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One advisor may be so convinced that the
            proposed agreement is in everyone's interest that he misses the lack of
            conviction with which they are agreeing to it. But the second or third set of eyes and ears, tuned at that
            time
            to the
            process more than the content, can interrupt and ask those who seem to be
            withholding their doubts to put them on the table. </p><br><br>

        <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Constant Challenge #3: The multidisciplinary
            team</h2>

        <p>The authors we cited in the introductory section of this
            article, among others, have discussed the necessity of working either as a
            practiced partnership of professionals from several disciplines, or a
            well-coordinated ad hoc group of advisors who find themselves involved with the
            same family (Barber, Hilburt-Davis, McKillip, Swartz, &amp; Wofford,
            2002). Increasingly, especially with
            financial families, a team of two or three consulting partners will need to
            coordinate with a number of long-time advisors as well as the family leaders. </p>

        <p>Unpredictable issues will surface in the course of such
            engagements, requiring the professional team to function flexibly and
            creatively, and to communicate efficiently among themselves. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All of which means that <i>trust is as vital
                in the consultant subsystem as it is in the sentient subsystem of the family
                business. </i>And if trust is vital,
            the consultants and advisors themselves are likely to need at least one Trust
            Catalyst just to moderate their own mutual apprehensions, professional
            differences and assertive personalities. The lead liaison with the family is probably in the best position to
            be
            a Trust Catalyst for both team and clients.  <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Individual clients will not have time, opportunity, or inclination
            to form a working alliance with each individual advisor. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But if most of the client family members,
            and especially their own Trust Catalysts, get comfortable with at least the
            Trust Catalyst on the consulting team, the engagement can work productively. </p>

        <p>The number of people in a family makes a huge difference in
            how well consultants can retain their trust. Compare two of our clients with approximately the same
            collective
            net
            worth: slightly over $2 billion. One
            has nine members, including spouses and children. The other has more than 100, of whom we met 76. </p>

        <p>The Doe family (not their real name) are third generation
            wealth creators. They grew up in one
            branch of a very wealthy family, but through separation of assets and their own
            success they now control a larger, sibling-owned portfolio of businesses. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They are a sister and two brothers, in early
            middle age. This client relationship
            has evolved over seven years. It began
            with conflict resolution by one of us, and guidance by the other in helping
            them hire a family office CEO with strengths appropriate to the transitions
            they were facing. We continued with
            close involvement with the new CEO, as well as their business CEO and
            investment managers. Gradually taking a
            back seat, our relationship now is primarily information providing. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The therapist member of our team has found
            and introduced leading child development and education professionals who
            provide diagnostic testing, therapy, or schools consultation. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although he still facilitates two family
            meetings a year, his presence there is that of a trusted resource who knows the
            history and personalities, rather than a therapist concerned with conflicts or
            crises. Our family office expert has
            direct contact only with their office CEO. </p>

        <p>Discussion with many of our colleagues<a name="OLE_LINK2">-</a>family
            process and content experts alike-indicates that this is the norm. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One person maintains a long-term advisory
            relationship, facilitating the clients' trust in a succession of other
            resources, as needed. </p>

        <p>With a larger group, however, it has been our experience that
            this sort of long-term leadership becomes exponentially more difficult to
            sustain. This makes sense
            mathematically: Trust is bound to be attenuated as a family grows
            branches. Although conflict may not
            reach the intensity that it does in a nuclear family, the family members know
            each other less well, and will know the consultants less well. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There will be little opportunity to detect
            and repair those inevitable tears in the fabric of the client-consultant
            alliance. Every additional family
            member increases the likelihood that a consultant will fail to maintain
            someone's trust. Every additional
            collaborator in the consultation does so as well. </p>

        <p>Furthermore, sheer numbers hold back what can reasonably
            accomplished over any period of time. We planned and facilitated two days of a three-day family retreat for
            the 76 members of the Ray family (51 adults, compared with the Doe family's
            five). The meeting was exciting, and
            most participants rated it very worthwhile. One technique we used was to exaggerate the differences in our
            perspectives, family relationships <i>versus </i>returns on financial capital,
            so as to model our ability to disagree yet actively listen to one another and
            enjoy our working relationship. They
            were a conflict-averse family, by nature and tradition, so we engaged in some
            respectful debate in front of them (Swartz, 1989). Another technique was to break them out into constituency
            groups
            that had never before expressed distinct positions; for example, all the
            in-laws in one room, all the 18 to 30-year-olds (some of whom barely knew one
            another) in another room. In each case,
            a new perspective emerged, which they reported to the whole family for the first
            time. This exercise broke up what our
            interviewees had described as entrenched factions. </p>

        <p>Those two days led them to add members to existing
            committees, form at least one new committee, and proceed to deliberate over
            some important questions. For example,
            one question they faced was whether they would initiate joint philanthropy in
            the fourth generation, about ten of whom were already adults. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The second and third generations had always
            done philanthropy separately, by branches. Another question was whether to start a private trust company to
            manage
            wealth for other high net-worth families. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></p>

        <p>Unfortunately, what we hoped would become an ongoing
            engagement didn't last long. Although
            we know that they moved forward with respect to the foregoing issues, they
            accepted only limited follow-up from us. Kaye did subsequently facilitate the office's Mission Statement
            committee, whose work the whole family ratified. Hamilton continued to be a resource for the CEO. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But we did not succeed in establishing a sufficient
            working alliance to leverage all that they had invested in our learning
            curve. Like some other families, they
            continue to bring various speakers in to each annual meeting (certainly a
            worthwhile thing to do) but have so far avoided tackling a major governance
            problem. We had hoped to lead them
            through an integrated, gradual, process of change. In retrospect, we fault ourselves for trying to take them
            too
            far, too fast. We overdid the content
            and underestimated the time it would take to let the ones who were comfortable
            with us serve as Trust Catalysts for the more reticent or apprehensive members
            of this very large family system. </p>

        <p>We find that the bigger the family is, the more they resist
            formalizing an advisory team to provide on-going assistance. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Cost cannot be claimed as a reason, as it
            might be with less wealthy families. Something else is at work. Unlike clinical therapy, in which the patient
            system feels both acute
            and chronic pain, and fears the consequences of failing to get help, the
            business systems we hear from often lack that awareness. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They want to take little nibbles of
            consultation, but don't believe they need as much help as they do. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Or perhaps they secretly do believe it. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Awareness of the many layers and players in
            their drama may make them feel less threatened by isolated presenters than by a
            less controllable team with a long-term assignment. When we hear the question, 'Why do we need more than one
            of
            you? '
            we have learned that the concern is not about money. It is about controlling the pace of change. </p><br><br>

        <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Be true to your team? </h2>

        <p>Differences among members of a consulting team are just as
            salient as those among the client family. Some differences are due to disciplinary perspectives. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example, technical advisors try to reduce
            uncertainty and provide solutions, while process advisors look for change
            through the family's own insight and dialectic. Attorneys are careful about rights, obligations, and
            compliance. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Psychologists think about risk to the
            family's emotional fabric. </p>

        <p>Other differences are matters of personality and working
            style. One of us has a greater need to
            plan our face-to-face meetings with groups-what we're going to say and who will
            do what. The other favors spontaneity:
            let's see what happens when we get in the room. But each of us will feel differently depending upon the
            clients
            and the task of the moment. Knowing
            each other well, and trusting each other to pursue or block an unplanned
            digression, is absolutely essential. </p>

        <p>This means that the more work we do together, the better we
            are as a team. We can be on a
            conference call with one or more clients, without body language or other visual
            clues, yet still signal our thoughts to one another sufficiently to coordinate
            our interview or advising. The more the
            two of us work with a third colleague-an attorney, for example, or a
            philanthropy expert-and the longer we work with a client's existing advisors,
            the more comfortable all of us are. And
            that, in turn, leads to a problem. How
            loyal should we be to one another? What
            if a family takes a dislike to one of us? It isn't our job to make all of them like all of us, all of the
            time. There are times when at least
            some members of the team have to be provocative. 'Please all, and you please none,' as Aesop said. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example, we may have to confront
            substance abuse, and a family's collusion in it. The more people in the room, the more certain it is that
            some of
            them will be unhappy with at least one of the consultants, even after a
            productive session. And the less likely
            that they will say so at the time. </p>

        <p>On the one hand, we have said that the long-term changes
            these families must make are best led by a consultant with broad,
            forward-looking vision. That person
            must form bonds with as many family members as possible, and definitely with
            their Trust Catalysts. He or she must
            also be a Trust Catalyst among the group of disparate outsiders. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But if the leader has to be an advocate for
            a <i>fixed</i> team, in the long run it isn't going to work. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

        <p>Sometimes, resistant clients will split the consultants:
            'You're helpful but your partner is not. 'This may be a pattern in their own dynamic that they would do well
            to
            look at, explore, and overcome. But it
            is also true that any of us may make a <i>faux pas</i>, or simply have a personal
            style that doesn't work well with particular clients. Should the team demonstrate loyalty-one for all and all
            for
            one-or should it demonstrate willingness to accommodate to this client system
            by replacing the miscast colleague? The
            answer is that teams should be neither too quick to dump a trusted colleague,
            nor too inflexible to consider doing so when it's in the best interests of the
            work. </p>

        <p>The person who is team leader and principal liaison needn't
            always be the consultant whom the family first engaged. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor does it matter whether a content expert
            or process facilitator performs this role. What matters is that he or she is one who (a) can best advocate
            for
            the
            long-term process, to client members and especially to their leaders and Trust
            Catalysts; and (b) is in a position to respond to the clients in timely fashion
            and <i>proactively</i> stay in touch with them during periods of dormancy. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

        <p>A content expert who has good rapport with family leaders has
            at least two things to fear when bringing in a family dynamics person as a
            co-consultant. One is that some or all
            family members who had been comfortable with the business/legal/financial
            consultation are suddenly uncomfortable with the suggestion that there may be
            something wrong with their family, mental health issues to be addressed, buried
            traumas to be exhumed. The other worry
            is quite the opposite: that a good facilitator might lead the family to discuss
            issues and find resolutions at odds with the content expert's
            recommendations. They might decide the
            latter has been enjoying too much trust. </p>

        <p>On the other hand, where a family therapist is the initial
            trusted consultant, bringing in a content expert can undermine the therapist's
            relationship with his clients. One of
            us learned this after he had worked for over a year with a sizeable
            international firm. Majority ownership
            was still with the founder, two of whose four children ran the company. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This sister and brother had always been
            close since childhood, but they were battling for two different visions and
            styles of leadership. (Nor did they
            love each other's spouses. )They came
            up with various ideas about splitting ownership, each acquiring control of one
            corporation and serving as minority shareholder and director of the
            other's. The parents adamantly wanted
            them to keep the whole empire intact and 'work together. '<span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, they agreed to be introduced to one
            of the leading financial advisors to family firms. </p>

        <p>We had a good meeting in the founder's office-both parents,
            both successors, the trusted family process consultant and the experienced,
            impressive financial expert. The latter
            stepped back from the successors' ideas about ways to divide the turf, to
            discuss what his firm would consider before making specific
            recommendations. He promised to get
            back to the founder with a suggested approach to the big picture, and did so
            soon thereafter. The initiating
            consultant was pleased with how the meeting had gone. Yet the parents not only rejected the idea of engaging
            the
            new
            firm, they soon ended the original engagement as well. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The agenda had been to fix their warring
            children. The consultant had enjoyed
            their trust as long as they could believe he was only hypothetically
            entertaining the scenario of division. Bringing in a very knowledgeable, polished expert who might have
            offered
            some such solution went beyond the hypothetical, apparently, to the
            antithetical. </p>

        <p>As we said earlier, well-designed exit strategies are vital
            for any kind of enterprise. Surely that
            aspect of teamwork is one which consultants should model, just as we model good
            communication, mutual respect, and our ability to disagree. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The consulting team shouldn't rigidly stick
            together. Replace a team member, if
            necessary, to keep the work going forward. The consultants must then nurture and repair their own
            relationships,
            outside of the client system. Just like
            a family. </p>

        <p>Assuming that is the smart position to take, what strong
            relationships must be required to implement it!What self-confidence!The
            world of multidisciplinary consulting is not to be entered by the thin-skinned
            or the overly competitive. There will
            sometimes be as much work for a team to do behind the scenes, off the clock, as
            there is on the client's bill. Especially in the course of their first five or ten cases together. </p>


        <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>In addition to the three constant challenges, we have learned
            some things, and raised a problem to which there is no easy solution. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The things we learned came from the literature
            cited in this article and from multidisciplinary study groups and consulting
            teams throughout the world, confirmed by our experience. <span
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They are:

        <ul>

            <li>The alliance continues even when the process is slow
                and disappointing. The consultants may
                be the only ones who know it isn't over. Hold onto your notes, and make it easy for dormant clients to
                reach
                out
                to you when they wake up. 
            </li>

            <li>Trust is itself a continuous process of building and
                testing. This is true in the client
                system, and the consultant system, and their intersection. 
            </li>

            <li>It will not be possible for every member of a
                consulting team to form an alliance with every member of the client
                system. Therefore, the lead liaison has
                to be as much of a Trust Catalyst as possible to both groups. 
            </li>


        </ul>

        <p>Ultimately, though,
            commitment to the principle of multidisciplinary teams raises the paradox about
            loyalty. In any sport, teams perform
            better the more they play together. On
            the other hand, members of a consulting team have to be replaceable, within
            reason. Consequently, managing our own
            set of dynamic relationships, building and testing trust, always preserving the
            option of replacing players, yet somehow without demoralizing those on the
            bench, may prove to be the most difficult process challenge of all. </p>
