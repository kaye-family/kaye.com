            Business</i>
            magazine, January 1989. At the time, I had worked with fewer than ten business-owning
            families, so most of what I said here was based on interviews and what I had
            learned from pioneers in the field such as fellow Chicagoans Ed Crego and
            Bernie Liebowitz. Twenty years later, after hundreds of clients, I wouldn't
            change a word of this advice about salaries in a family firm. (Reprint

        <p><b><u>Why Can't Family Life Be
            More Like a Business Lunch?</u> (1990)</b> <i>Family Business</i> magazine, February 1990. (Reprint
            available from <a href="https://www.familybusinessmagazine.com/"
                              target="_blank"><i>Family Business</i></a>.) The more important a relationship
            is to us, paradoxically, the more we tend to take the other person for granted
            and shortcut the basic communication skills (such as active listening) that
            most people employ well in dealing with customers or strangers.</p>

        <p><b><u>Can You Keep a Secret?
            Maybe You Shouldn't</u> (1990)</b> <i>Family Business</i> magazine, April 1990. (Reprint
            available from <a href="https://www.familybusinessmagazine.com/"
                              target="_blank"><i>Family Business</i></a>.) Family secrets are always risky;
            even more so when they affect business succession, estate planning, or chronic
            family/business conflicts.</p>

        <p><b><u>Resolving Conflict</u> (1991)</b> <i>Family Business</i> magazine, January 1991. (Reprinted in
            <a href="/books/dynamics-of-family-business.html"><i>The Dynamics of Family Business</i></a>.)
            Summarizes how a
            family systems therapist looks at the repeating cycle of conflict in a family firm.</p>

        <p><b><u>Penetrating the Cycle of
            Sustained Conflict</u> (1991)</b> <i>Family Business Review</i>, 1991, Vol. IV, pp. 21-44.
            (Reprinted in <a href="/books/dynamics-of-family-business.html"><i>The Dynamics of
                Family Business</i></a>.) The first of my academic articles for <i>FBR</i>
            discussed the &quot;problem maintenance cycle,&quot; a central concept in the
            work of William Pinsof at Northwestern University, which I found to be as
            valuable in addressing family business conflict as it is in family therapy
            generally.</p>

        <p><b><u>The Kid Brother</u> (1992)</b>< <i>Family Business Review</i>, 1992, Vol. V, pp. 237-256.
            (Reprinted in <a href="/books/dynamics-of-family-business.html"><i>The Dynamics of Family Business</i></a>.)
            Patterns occur across families, transcending regions, cultures, wealth and
            other variables. One of the first such patterns I noticed in family firms was
            the situation I call &quot;prisoners of the family business.&quot; The
            &quot;kid brother syndrome&quot; is a subcategory of that.</p>

            Family's Business</b></a><b> (1992)</b> This short summary of &quot;The Kid
            Brother&quot; was one of a set of columns I syndicated to a number of trade
            associations. </p>

        <p><b><u>Who's the Client?</u> (1992)</b> (Short
            article in the Family Firm Institute Newsletter, reprinted in <a
                    href="/books/dynamics-of-family-business.html"><i>The Dynamics of Family Business</i></a>.)
            Advisors to family business come from widely divergent professional
            backgrounds. We learn about one another's perspectives through organizations like
            the Family Firm Institute. In FFI's newsletter, I discussed fundamental
            differences in who or what we see as our client, and our ethical
            responsibilities. How do we serve multiple family members' contradictory and
            sometimes secret agendas? The same issues were still on my mind 12 years later
            when Sara Hamilton and I wrote &quot;<a
                    href="/family-business/article_trustconsulting.html">Roles of Trust
                in Consulting to Financial Families</a>.&quot;</p>

        <p><a
                href="/family-business/boardroom.pdf"><b>On Speaking Terms:
            Boardroom Communication</b></a><b> (1994)</b>. <i>The Journal of Corporate
            Governance</i>, Vol. XV, No. 89. Boardroom conflict can be positive and
            creative.</p>

        <p><b><u>When Faith Comes First</u> (1995)</b>
            <i>Family Business</i> magazine, Spring 1995. (Reprinted in <a
                    href="/books/dynamics-of-family-business.html"><i>The Dynamics of Family
                Business</i></a>.) Other contributors
            on the same topic listed only the <u>advantages</u> in strong religious faith
            for a business family. But there are some disadvantages as well.</p>

        <p><b><u>How to Rebuild Business
            Trust</u> (1995)</b> <i>Family Business</i> magazine, Summer 1995. (Reprinted
            in <a href="/books/dynamics-of-family-business.html"><i>The Dynamics of Family
                Business</i></a>.) Trust is an interaction process, not a static quality. I had
            discussed this in <a href="/books/family-rules-raising-responsible-children.html"><i>Family Rules</i></a>
            (1984) as well as in <a href="/books/workplace-wars-and-how-to-end-them.html"><i>Workplace
                Wars</i></a> (1994). Here I noticed something simple and remarkably useful
            about trust and mistrust: It helps if family members clarify whether their
            statement &quot;I don't trust X&quot; is about the person's honesty, or about
            his or her motives, or about particular abilities.</p>

        <p><b><u>The Bottom Line on Loans
            to Relatives</u> (1995)</b> <i>Family Business</i> magazine, Autumn 1995. (Reprint
            available from <a
                    href="https://www.familybusinessmagazine.com/"
                    target="_blank"><i>Family Business</i></a>.) Most important is to make it
            clear, in writing, when this is a genuine loan with expectations of repayment,
            so that expectations of both parties are the same.</p>

        <p><b><u>Psychologists or
            Sycophants?</u> (1995)</b> (Opinion column in the Family Firm Institute Newsletter,
            Winter 1995. &quot;High and mighty rhetoric about the virtuousness of our work
            and of our clients ... seems to ignore some of those clients' antisocial
            activities.&quot;</p>

        <p><b><u>Terms of Entitlement</u> (1996)</b> <i>Corporate
            Detroit</i>, March 1996. (Reprinted in <a href="/books/dynamics-of-family-business.html"><i>The Dynamics of
            Family Business</i></a> Two
            problems of
            &quot;entitlement&quot; come up frequently in our work: too much or too little.

        <p><b><u>Equal Isn't Always Fair</u> (1996)</b> <i>Family
            Business</i> magazine, Spring 1996. By Catherine McCarthy and Kenneth Kaye.

        <p><b><u>When the Family Business
            is a Sickness</u> (1996)</b> <i>Family Business Review</i>, 1996, Vol. IX, pp.
            347-368. (Reprinted in <a href="/books/dynamics-of-family-business.html"><i>The
                Dynamics of Family Business</i></a>.) My most controversial and, I think, most
            important contribution to this field: &quot; ... in many cases the family
            business is not the patient but an illness afflicting the family. These are
            cases in which keeping it going means keeping the family sick. These owners <i>use
                their business to retard the normal development of their children and
                themselves</i>. Their health as a family business cannot be 'restored' because
            it isn't healthy for them <i>to be</i> a family business.&quot;</p>

        <p><a
                href="/family-business/sicknessSpanish.pdf"><b>Cuando
            la Empresa Familiar es una Enfermedad</b></a> (Traducci&oacute;n en espa&ntilde;ol por Francisco Javier
            Macias. Cuando
            un negocio compartido retrasa el desarollo del Ciclo Vital de ambas
            generaci&oacute;nes, puede no ser possible para los consultores &quot;restaurar&quot; su sistema
            de salud como empresa familiar, porque ya es insalubre para estas familias
            estar todos juntos en la empresa. Fantas&iacute;as como salvar su empresa familiar, o
            realizar una sucesi&oacute;n a la siguiente generaci&oacute;n, son equivocadas. El autor
            argumenta que cuando el desarollo del ego de los padres es inadequado, la
            individuaci&oacute;n normal les provoca a ellos y a sus hijos una ansiedad tal que
            hace que la empresa funcione como una adicci&oacute;n, El rol primario para el
            consultor ser&aacute; reconocer estos casos, diagnosticarlos con cuidado e intervener
            de forma que motive a la siguiente generaci&oacute;n a explorer un amplio abanico de
            opci&oacute;nes.)</p>

                href="/family-business/article_conflictopportunity.html"><b>Conflict
            as Opportunity for Change</b></a><b> (1996)</b> Family Business Network <i>Newsletter</i>
            No. 14, April 1996. (Reprinted in <a href="/books/dynamics-of-family-business.html"><i>The
                Dynamics of Family Business</i></a>.) A short summary of the systematic
            approach I adapted from family therapy to resolve work group conflicts. The
            article includes a diagram of trust as a mutual process, as experience leads a
            relationship to become either gradually more trusting or (sometimes abruptly)
            less trusting.</p>

        <p><b><u>Comment on Mediation</u> (1997)</b> <i>Family
            Business Review</i>, 1997, Vol. X, pp. 131-134. (Reprinted in <a
                href="/books/dynamics-of-family-business.html"><i>The Dynamics of Family Business</i></a>.)
            <i>FBR</i> editor Joe Astrachan asked me to comment on an article by John
            Haynes and Thomas Uzdin entitled &quot;Resolving Family Business Disputes
            through Mediation&quot; (1997). I found the authors' claims for the utility of
            mediation far too broad, as opposed to a family systems consulting approach.</p>

        <p><b><u>On Trying to Remake Others</u> (1998)</b> <i>Family
            Business</i> magazine, Winter 1998. (Reprinted in <a href="/books/dynamics-of-family-business.html"><i>The
            Dynamics of Family Business</i></a>.)
            Hoping to solve
            relationship prblems by convincing the other person to change is worse than a
            waste of time--it's a way of refusing to do the only constructive thing that
            might improve the situation: to try some different behavior ourselves, in hopes
            of getting a better reaction.</p>

                href="/books/dynamics-of-family-business.html"><i>The Dynamics of Family Business</i></a>.)
            The success of a family enterprise should be measured by the opportunities it
            creates for the next generation, whether they choose to go on with that
            business or to follow their own dreams. This was one of the essays that led my
            friend Joe Astrachan, editor of <i>FBR</i>, to dub me &quot;the Dr. Kevorkian
            of the family business profession.&quot; </p>

            Enterprise</b></a><b> (2010)</b> The difference between trust conflicts in
            family financial offices and those in ordinary family businesses is instructive
            with regard to the causes and resolution of human conflicts in general.</p>

            Conflict and Human Nature</b></a><b> (2010)</b> The risk involved in relying on
            others is greater for humans than for animals that rely on each other's
            instincts. Human individuals have to be prepared to doubt and verify one
            another's conformance to expectations. Vigilance, suspicion of betrayal, and
            reprisal are healthy for <i>Homo sapiens</i>, because trust is so vital to our
            survival.</p>

            <b> (2012)</b> We human beings necessarily and instinctively count on others' trustworthiness,
            but we tend to underestimate the likelihood of their developing new goals and different priorities.
            Then we interpret the latter as betrayal of trust.</p>
