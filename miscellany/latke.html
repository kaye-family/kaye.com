<h3>The University of Chicago <i>Latke-Hamentash</i> Symposium, November 1977</h3>

<p><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Introduction</b> [<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>each panelist writes his own, delivered by campus rabbi Daniel Leifer</i>]:
</p>

<p><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kenneth Kaye, Assistant Professor of
Educational Psychology, attended his first </i>Latke<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>-</i>Hamentash<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Symposium at the
age of three. It made such a strong impression on him that he has not touched
either a </i>latke<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> or a </i>hamentash<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> for 28 years. However, his academic
interest in the subject has remained strong. Dietary issues played an important
part in his formative years: his parents believed that bacon or pork might give
you trichinosis unless it was burnt to a crisp.</i></p>

<p><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>His career in child psychology and family
interaction processes probably owes its origins to the fact that interpersonal
relations in his own family were somewhat problematic. His grandparents were
very critical of Jews who became assimilated. For example, they could never
forgive his Uncle Melvin for marrying a girl who said </i>b&apos;mitzvo<u>t</u>ov<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>. They knew she made a special point of
saying it, just to drive them crazy. Eventually she had trouble remembering
whether it was </i>b&apos;mitzvo<u>s</u>ov<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> or </i>b&apos;mitzvo<u>t</u>ov<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> she wasn&apos;t supposed to say, so she would
say both: “</i>Asher kidishanu b&apos;mitzvosov—<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>er,</i>
tov, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sorry!”</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>This was the last straw, and finally Melvin himself beat her brains out
with a challah. From that time on, no one in the family could eat challah
without being reminded of Miriam, so </i>hamentashen<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> and </i>latke<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>s became staples of
the Sabbath meal. Kenneth, unable to eat either food without being reminded of
the pathetic symposium his parents had dragged him to at age three, developed a
phobia of Sabbath candles. It was recommended to his parents that they put him
in an institution, but they felt graduate school would be cheaper.</i></p>

<p><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kaye&apos;s professional career is reaching its
apex with his appearance here tonight. He played minor league ball with the
Cambridge Pragmatists, was sold to Seattle where he played one season, then was
traded to Chicago for a left-handed pitcher and two outfielders. This is his
seventh season with the Maroons, who have until December 15<sup>th</sup> to
decide, now that he&apos;s too old to pitch regularly, whether they want to send him
back down to the minors or keep him on as a third base coach.</i></p>

<p><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kaye&apos;s only scholarly book (I am sorry to
say) is entitled </i>Left or Right: Which is Better?<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> – a treatise on breastfeeding – but he is at work on another book now,
tentatively called </i>Latke and Hamentash: Which is Which?<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You may also have seen his
article in last month&apos;s </i>Cosmopolitan <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entitled
“Orgasms: Will they hurt your baby?”</i></p>

<p><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Many students and colleagues are unaware
that Kaye is also a best-selling popular author. His first novel was called </i>I
Married a Shikse—<u>and</u> <u>Lived</u>!! <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>And he recently published its sequel: </i>Divorce—Shikse
Style.</p>

<p><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>We are greatly honored that Prof. Kaye
consented to be a member of our panel this year, especially from the point of
view of his expertise on the subject of mutual influences between mother and
child and their role in socialization. The title of his paper is:</i></p>

<p><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>“<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Latke</i>-<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hamentash</i> Interaction”</span></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Distinguished
colleagues, learned rabbi, dear friends, mother, father, grandparents, cousins,
aunts and uncles: Today … oh, excuse me … It is a great honor to be invited to
share my prodigious knowledge with you, at what I hope to convince you should
be the <u>last</u> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Latke</i>-<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hamentash</i> Symposium. The many eminent
men—and one or two lucky women—who have participated in this symposium all have
been <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pundits </i>of the first order. It
is difficult to find anything new and/or clever to say on the subject any more,
as my colleagues have demonstrated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not
a stale bun on the word <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hamentash</i>,
nor a tasteless reference to heartburn, nor a trite spurious etymology nor an
anti-Semitic stereotype has escaped being incorporated into at least half a
dozen of my predecessors&apos; contributions over the past 32 years. In the face of
this challenge, I felt the only way I might possibly make an original and
worthwhile contribution would be to approach the topic seriously and to report
some original research.</p>

<p>While it is
obviously ridiculous to analyze an ethnic cuisine from the point of view of
mathematics, linguistics, music, etc., it is quite valid to do so from the
point of view of child psychology and particularly my own field, mother-infant
interaction. For the basis of culture is socialization, which takes place
primarily in the process of interaction between children and their mothers. We
now know that this process begins at birth—probably much earlier—and that the
entire basis of the child&apos;s personality and intellectual achievement is largely
determined by the time he or she is two weeks old. Later issues such as the
four Ws (weaning, walking, and wee-wee), which received so much attention in
the past, are now recognized to be red pickled herrings.</p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Background of
the Problem</b></p>

<p>Although we
are only recently coming to realize how early in a child&apos;s life basic
personality and school achievement are shaped, at a more general level the
importance of the Jewish mother has long been recognized, as has the importance
of Jewish cooking. As Levi-Strauss wrote in his classic cross-cultural
best-seller, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Goy of Cooking</i>, “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Une dimension essentielle pour tout
structuralisme genetique est <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">celle</st1:City></st1:place>
de cuisine.</i>” Translating freely, “The Jews have long known what the
Gentiles have not, that your children <u>are </u>what they eat.”</p>

<p>The importance
of particular foods in a child&apos;s psychic development has been well stressed in
Jewish folklore. We have such sayings as “a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>knish</i>
in time saves wine,” “spare the lox and spoil the child,” “a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>kishke</i> a day makes the doctor stay (he
should only notice your daughter),” and “eat, eat, it&apos;ll go in the garbage.”</p>

<p>For those with
more scholarly appetites, the field is dominated of course by Freud, with his
major work <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Constipation and its
Discontents</i>. Freud had researched the subject of Jewish culture thoroughly
because of his lifelong attempt, nearly successful, to pass himself off as a
Jew. (As you know, it was not discovered until Freud&apos;s death that he was not
circumcised.) He pretended to be Jewish because he wisely foresaw that
psychoanalysts would never accept a non-Jew as their leader. The main question
behind all of Freud&apos;s work was how Jewish versus Gentile mothers affect their
children&apos;s psychological growth differently as a function of a diet consisting
of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>latke</i>s and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>hamentashen</i> versus one consisting of Velveeta cheese and Wonder
bread. His best-known book on this subject is unfortunately known by its
wrongly translated title <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Ego and the
Id</i>; the true title is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Goy and the
Yid</i>.</p>

<p>Today we are
not concerned with the cross-cultural comparison so much as the question how <u>within</u>
Jewish culture, different foods lead to different personalities: from the point
of view of our special topic this evening, what are the early determinants of a
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>latke</i>dich versus a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hamentashenlikh</i> syndrome?</p>

<p>The other
great scholar in my field <u>is</u> a Jew, who (I regret to say) has done
everything to conceal his Jewish roots: Jean Piaget. Like many of you, I always
thought that Piaget was the Swiss word for ‘wristwatch&apos;, but I recently learned
that it comes from two Lithuanian words <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pia</i>,
or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pisher</i>, meaning ‘boy&apos;, and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>get</i>: Jew. “Jewboy”. So, Piaget is of
Jewish descent, though highly assimilated. He tells us in his autobiography: “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Une dimension essentielle pour tout
structuralisme genetique est <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">celle</st1:City></st1:place>
de cuisine.</i>” Translating freely, “My mother had two completely different
recipes for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tzimmes</i>: everyday <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tzimmes</i>, and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>gahntze tzimmes</i>, which she made only for company meals.” Piaget
goes on to tell us that his mother&apos;s everyday <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>tzimmes</i> was simply awful, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dure
a la concret</i>, as hard as concrete, but the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>tzimmes </i>she made for <u>formal</u> occasions was a perfectly
integrated culinary structure that would melt in your mouth. There can be
little doubt that this disequilibrium Piaget experienced from early childhood,
between the concrete <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tzimmes</i> and the
formal <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tzimmes</i>, is the origin of his
entire theory of concrete and formal operations, which for those of you who are
ignorant … of Piaget&apos;s work, is his theory that the mind of the child is like a
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>latke</i> until he reaches his 13<sup>th</sup>
birthday, when his mind transforms itself into a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>hamentash</i>.</p>

<p>This has led
directly to the hypothesis guiding most current work in this field, namely that
if a child is fed too many <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>latke</i>s
without a sufficient number of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hamentashen</i>
as chasers, he or she will become (intellectually speaking) constricted, get
poor grades and have trouble getting into medical school. At the opposite
extreme, the overfeeding of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hamentashen</i>
with insufficient <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>latke</i>s leads to the
child&apos;s becoming carried away with higher intellectual activity, bumping into
walls and never quite being able to get <u>out</u> of medical school, let alone
marry a nice Jewish girl. Theory holds that either extreme is directly due to
the mother: that there are, in fact, “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>latke</i>-type”
and “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hamentash</i>-type” mothers, with
different effects upon their children&apos;s development, both bad.</p>

<p>My students
and I set out to test this hypothesis, and to develop a diagnostic tool with
predictive validity from the very earliest interactions of the mother-infant
dyadic open social system.</p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Method</b></p>

<p>We observed 12
mothers breastfeeding their infants on several occasions each, and on the basis
of a close and incredibly detailed examination of the … data(!), we categorized
the mothers into four groups. Now, there is absolutely no truth to the
insinuation that our choice of breastfeeding as a situation for observation was
motivated by any but the purest scientific reasons. One member of my tenure
review committee even went so far as to accuse me of an obsession with mammary
voyeurism (these things get out, you know) but no serious scholar pays
attention to boobs like that. Nor is it true that my mother wears combat boots.</p>

<p>It so happens
that we can tell, by elaborate computerized microanalysis of our sophisticated and
detailed codings of the feeding session, what type of mother each of our
subjects was going to be. The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>latkedikh</i>
mother is one whose only concern is nourishing the infant, keeping him in close
contact with her body and largely hidden from view; she wishes to retain him in
her womb. Not surprising, for the Talmud tells us that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>latke</i>s were first created as direct imitations of the placenta:
round but otherwise formless, full of veins, and rather slimy. The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hamentash</i>, of course, symbolizes birth:
the dilation of the cervix, to be precise. First the seeds are deposited in the
moist dough, which is then closed up and baked, and finally when they are ready
to “bear fruit,” as it were, they expand and expose their contents to the
world. Seriously, this bulging triangle is a crowning achievement of culinary
labor, and delivery. The beautiful Queen Esther herself, in the act of giving
birth to King Ahasuerus&apos;s first-born son, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Darfgein
Pishen</i> (this is written in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Megillah</i>
Part Two), allowed the royal pastry chef to model her private parts in creating
the first <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hamentash</i>. You may laugh,
but you must admit this food is, indeed, among the delicacies of all countries,
the epitome of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mohns veneris</i>.</p>

<p>Accordingly,
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hamentashenlikh</i> mother is one
whose principal concern is less with the nutritive aspect of breastfeeding than
with the presentation of her child to the world. While the placenta- or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>latke</i>-oriented mother is reluctant to be
separated from her infant, virtually smothering him with breast milk,
applesauce, sour cream, etc., the genital or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>hamentash</i>-oriented mother is perhaps a little too eager to be free
of her infant. We find, for example, they push for early achievement of the
four Ws.</p>

<p>Our 12
subjects were all Jewish women living in <st1:place w:st="on">Hyde Park</st1:place>,
and the study was naturally restricted to first-born male infants. There was
one slight deception involved in the recruiting of subjects: in order to get
volunteers, we found it necessary to sat that an award would be given to the
best mother. All of the mothers were virgins, incidentally, and the
observations were done in the homes under naturalistic conditions, as shown in
the first slide.</p>

<p>The third,
matzo ball group was similar to the first two in recognizing the importance of
food; in fact, all three of these types fall into the superordinate category,
Gastric Jewesses.</p>

<p>Now, these
correlation coefficients, I hasten to point out, are not what we would call
statistically significant. On a scale from zero to 1.0, they are more toward
the low end. But if I might be permitted to speculate beyond the data, I
suggest that the relation between maternal and child measures is consistently
positive and greater for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>latke</i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hamentash</i> types than for the
control groups. Most important, theoretically, is the fact that these small but
suggestive correlations are absolutely identical for the two types. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Latkedikh</i> versus <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>hamentashenlikh</i> mothering seems to make no difference at all.</p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Discussion</b></p>

<p>Given the
superficial level at which this issue has been addressed in the past, you might
expect us to shrug our shoulders and consider the case closed. That is not the
way we operate, however, in the Department of Education. Fourteen
dissertations, six M.A. theses, and 11 trial research papers based on these
findings have led to the firm conclusion that more research is needed, and we
have recently submitted to the National Science Foundation a
multi-disciplinary, multi-year, multi-media, multi-dollar grant proposal to
carry this work forward to its logical end.</p>

<p>Which is, (a)
by age two weeks when our observations were made it is already <u>too late</u>
to diagnose the future of the mother-infant dyadic open social dyadic
interactional system; and (b) <u>neither</u> the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>latke</i> nor the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hamentash</i>
is an adequate paradigm for the true complexity of early dyadic open systemic
social interaction in the context of the mother-infant dyad.</p>

<p>This should
come as no surprise to Jewish scholars. It was our heritage that originated the
idea that it is less important <u>what</u> you eat than what you eat it <u>with</u>
and what plates you eat it on. Context is everything. Only a true systems
approach can possibly hope to arrive at the truth. We reject the simple
input-output models of alimentary processes in favor of a complete
microanalysis of context-dependent transformation rules. As the Torah says,
“Thou shalt not eat pork or shrimp except in Chinese restaurants.”</p>

<p>Viewing the
dyad as an open system from Birth, we find that a young mother is subject to a
myriad of interconnected, interrelated but conflicting influences—from her mother,
her in-laws, the doctors and nurses. We have videotaped a number of births, and
stop-action photography reveals that the mother is indeed the center of
attention, but it is the kind of attention which can easily lead her at the
moment of Birth to withdraw into a shell—as our final slide shows.</p>
