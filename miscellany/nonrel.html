To social anthropologists, the kinship terms of
a particular society&apos;s language reveal the whole structure of that culture. The
<span class=SpellE>Yuukliu</span> Eskimos, for example, make a distinction
between <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mukluk</i>, the uncle who is
one&apos;s mother&apos;s brother, and <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>lukmuk</i></span>, one&apos;s father&apos;s brother. We speakers of English lump
both those collateral male relatives into the same category, and we toss the
husbands of our aunts in as well. In our culture it is the person himself, and
what he can do for you, that matters; not his blood relationship.</p>

<p>Kinship terms are especially revealing when they designate
relationships that one culture deems <span class=GramE>unimportant ,</span> and
therefore nameless, while another culture deems them so important that a
special term is needed. For example, one&apos;s married children&apos;s parents-in-law
are thought of so rarely in the Anglo-Saxon culture that no term for them is
needed; the fact that they have a special name in Yiddish, <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>machetunim</i></span>, indicates their
importance as mutual objects of cordial contempt.</p>

<p>Societies change over time, however, and sometimes language is a little
slow to keep pace with changes in the culture. Anthropologists need a new set
of kinship terms to capture the complexity of family relationships in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Some
examples:</p>

<p><span class=GramE><b>Ex-husbands-in-law.</b></span>
<span class=GramE>One&apos;s wife&apos;s previous husbands.</span> (Similarly, one&apos;s
husband&apos;s previous wives are one&apos;s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ex-wives-in-law</i>.)</p>

<p><span class=GramE><b>In-husband.</b></span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> </b><span class=GramE>One&apos;s ex-wife&apos;s
current husband.</span> This person is the counterpart of the
ex-husband-in-law: I am one of my in-husband&apos;s ex-husbands-in-law. However, the
relationship is not symmetrical because each ex-husband has no more than one in-husband (legally) while 
an in-husband may have several ex-husbands-in-law. Usually only the most recent
ex-husband-in-law matters to an in-husband, unless the more remote
ex-husbands-in-law&apos;s children are still living with their mother and the
in-husband (their stepfather). (The children&apos;s step<i>mother</i> is her ex-<i>wives</i>-in-law&apos;s
in-<i>wife</i>. Henceforth, such obvious
gender reversals will be omitted in the interest of brevity.)</p>

<p><b>First husband once removed, etc.
</b>This set of terms refers to the changes in person A&apos;s ex-spouse&apos;s status
with each subsequent remarriage of A. If I am my wife&apos;s third husband, for
example, there may be considerable animosity between her <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>second</i> husband and us, especially if she left him for me or if she <span
class=SpellE>hasn&apos;t</span> forgiven him for leaving her. But her <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>first</i> husband, now the first husband
once removed, is off the hook. The second husband will become the second
husband once removed when and if I cease to be the in-husband.</p>

<p><span class=GramE><b>Step-grandparents
vs. grand-stepparents.</b></span><b> </b>The
former are the parents of one&apos;s stepparents, who enter one&apos;s life later than
one&apos;s blood grandparents, and often depart sooner (see next entry). The latter
are one&apos;s parents&apos; stepparents, who, if one knows them at all, may be the only
grandparents one has.</p>

<p><span class=GramE><b>Ex-step-grandmother.</b></span>
<span class=GramE>The mother of one&apos;s ex-stepfather or ex-stepmother.</span>
Sometimes called the disappearing grandmother, this person stops sending
sweaters from Lord &amp; Taylor and is never heard from again. However, one is
not expected to return her previous gifts, and the ex-stepparent should not
claim them in the settlement.</p>

<p><span class=GramE><b>Step-step-grandfather.</b></span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> </b><span class=GramE>One&apos;s stepfather&apos;s
stepfather.</span> He may be acquired at the time one acquires the stepfather,
or later (if the step-grandmother remarries after her son does.)</p>

<p><span class=GramE><b>Ex-step-step-grandparents.</b></span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> </b>There are two kinds: one&apos;s <span
class=GramE>stepparents&apos; ex-stepparents,</span> and one&apos;s ex-step-parents&apos;
stepparents. The distinction is trivial, since all disappear upon acquiring
this status.</p>

<p><span class=GramE><b>Step-ex-step-grandfather.</b></span>
<span class=GramE>A non-grandfather whom a child&apos;s new stepfather&apos;s mother
divorced prior to her son&apos;s marriage to the child&apos;s mother.</span> The set is
empty on the stepmother&apos;s side unless the children live more than half the year
with their father and stepmother, and the stepmother&apos;s ex-stepfather had
married her mother while she (the stepmother) was still a child.</p>

<p><b>Half-children once removed. </b>One&apos;s
ex-spouse&apos;s children by subsequent marriages, but only if one or more of one&apos;s
own children also live with that ex-spouse. The latter children are then the
in-husband&apos;s or in-wife&apos;s stepchildren, which is why this term is needed for
the relationship between oneself and one&apos;s children&apos;s half-siblings.</p>

<p><span class=GramE><b>Ex-brothers
and ex-sisters.</b></span> The
offspring of a child&apos;s ex-stepparents, but only those who lived in the same
household with the child and were called &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; and &ldquo;sisters&rdquo; for at least
a month prior to their parent and the child&apos;s parent separating. Children are
remarkably tolerant of such <span class=SpellE>kithship</span> updates, but
problems occasionally arise if they happen to run into their ex-siblings later,
and fall in love. If an ex-brother marries his ex-sister, each one&apos;s parent (on
that side) becomes the in-law once removed of his or her own ex-spouse, and
that parent&apos;s current spouse (if any) becomes stepparent-in-law to his or her
own stepchildren twice removed. <span class=GramE>However, if the ex-brother
and ex-sister live together without marrying (as who can blame them?),</span>
then their four closest parents remain their ex-stepparents as
stepfathers-in-common-law to one member of the couple and
stepmothers-in-common-law to the other.</p>

<p><b>Stepchildren twice removed. </b><span
class=GramE>The children by <i>previous</i>
marriages, of one&apos;s in-spouse.</span> The paradox: Your stepchildren (not
removed) are not related to you by blood. Your half-children once removed <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>are </i>related to you (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>sort of</i>: by blood once removed), because they are half-siblings of
your own natural children. Nonetheless, one sees them rarely if ever, whereas
one sees far too much of one&apos;s stepchildren not removed. Stepchildren <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>twice </i>removed are not related to you
(unless your in-husband or in-wife happens to be either your own relative or an
ex-in-law), yet you may see more of them than of your step- and half-children <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>once</i> removed, because the twice removed
are likely to be closer in age to your own children, live with them for part of
the summer, and can&apos;t very well be left behind when you pick up your natural
children for a day at Great America. (A friend of mine found himself at the top
of the Hell Drop strapped into a cabriolet with two screaming stepchildren
twice removed, his glasses falling off, his wallet missing, without the
faintest idea where his stepchildren once removed, his stepchildren not
removed, his children, half-children, and ex-children were. His girlfriend, it
turned out, had picked up a sailor and gone home.)<u></u></p>
