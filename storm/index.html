Where do they intend to go with the twin turboprop aircraft, its nine passengers and three crew members? And why was this domestic Mexican airline the target?  </p>

<p><p><p>"Great Story"</p>
<p>
Review by Dan S. Tong on <i>Amazon.com</i>, 12/20/2012

<p>I started reading this book in bed and about 5 hours later I had it finished, because I just could not put it down.

Unlike some thrillers, the plot is quite believable -it could happen. One reason for this is the amount of detail about flying a small commercial airplane as well as the excellent writing, and the other is that there are no protagonists with legendary martial art skills to save the day. In fact the admirable qualities of the two main characters are competence in their profession coupled with a large dose of general smarts.

<p><p>At times, the book reminded me of Michael Crichton's works, because of the way the technical aspects of flying, a central concern, were woven into the plot. The characters many admirable and not so admirable qualities of real people, including the psychological blinders that we all have to some extent.

<p><p>This story could make a great TV movie in addition to being a great read. <i>Highly recommended.</i>
